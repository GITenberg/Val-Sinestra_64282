<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT twenty-five years ago, Pedro Gonzola
bought that handsome brown stone residence
at the corner of Twelfth Street and Fifth
Avenue, and presented it to his bride on their wedding
day. As the name implied, they were of
Spanish origin, and known as devout Catholics, supporting
the Church spiritually and materially.</p>

<p>Shortly before Julie was born, her father died
suddenly, stricken down with heart failure. The
young widow was stunned by the loss of her handsome
adoring husband; her uncontrollable grief
nearly cost her the life of her coming child, who suffered
from her mother&#8217;s anguish&mdash;at least that&#8217;s
what the good Dr. McClaren said.</p>

<p>After her great misfortune Mrs. Gonzola gave
up the world and devoted herself to her religion and
the care of her little daughter. Julie was sent to the
Convent of the Sacred Heart in Seventeenth Street.
The Sisters educated her under the personal supervision
of her mother; their reports were satisfactory;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the child was docile and receptive, but
inclined to emotional exaggeration; she would remain
in the chapel long after the other children had
left, and once they found her prostrate before the
Virgin in a state of ecstatic self-oblivion, which
ended in a fit of hysteria. There was no cause for
worry, as otherwise she was &#8220;full of life&#8221; and a
general favorite. Mrs. Gonzola tried conscientiously
to impress her daughter with the dignity of
her wealth, social position, and family distinction;
but as the girl grew into a woman, there was an
ever-present irritating sense of failure.</p>

<p>Julie Gonzola at sixteen, with her brilliant exotic
beauty, was a mystery to her friends, her mother,
herself. She was acutely conscious of strange emotions,
which she instinctively concealed; hers was a
nature of unexpected impulses, tragic possibilities,
baffling secrets. She came of an old stock on her
father&#8217;s side, and on her mother&#8217;s she could look
down a long corridor, where she saw shadowy
forms, which frightened her. She was different
from her girl friend, who was care-free, bubbling,
sparkling, dashing along like a brook which overflows
its bounds out of sheer rapture.</p>

<p>Maud Ailsworth lived down the street. There
were no complications in <i>her</i> life. She ruled her
mother, who was an invalid, and physically her inferior.
Maud romped all day long in the street
with the boys. Mrs. Gonzola never allowed Julie
to do that; she was very indulgent in her way, denying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
the girl nothing&mdash;but freedom. Julie was outwardly
submissive; she was sorry for her mother,
who sat alone in her room crying, silent iron tears
of impotent despair.</p>

<p>There were two boys in the street whom Maud
liked; as she grew older she determined to marry
one of them, but she found to her great disappointment
they were both hot after Julie. Floyd Garrison,
a pretty boy of an old American family, was
very well brought up; Martin Steele was a mongrel,
a brute, a ruffian, but there was something very
likable about him. Maud looked on, watched them
wrestling for the privilege of carrying Julie&#8217;s books
when she came from school, with her maid. There
were fist fights for her as children, rivalry as youths,
and bitterness as men. But Maud wasn&#8217;t discouraged;
Julie couldn&#8217;t marry both of them; there
would be always one left for her. Then she had
Tom Dillon in reserve; he was common, but she
owned him; he was her slave.</p>

<p>Julie was afraid of Martin Steele; he had bad
manners and a violent temper. He was always
mussing up her hair, and winding her curls around
his fingers. Floyd was too polite to do that. There
was a party at Maud Ailsworth&#8217;s; Tom Dillon, that
mischievous imp, put out the lights. The boy next
to Julie kissed her, pressing her to him with terrible
force; it was Martin. After that, he kissed her
whenever he found her alone, and he managed it
often. She liked his hot unboyish kisses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>The Garrisons had lived four generations in a
little wooden house in East Twelfth Street, &#8220;a very
pretty shanty&#8221; Martin called it, set back, with a
garden, and a wooden fence to protect the lawn and
flowers from passing vandals.</p>

<p>A portrait of the ancestor who founded the
family fortune hangs today in our Museum. &#8220;Yan
Geritsen, baker,&#8221; endowed with business sagacity,
bought land under water in New Amsterdam for
&#8220;thirty cents,&#8221; left it to his son, with orders not to
sell. Succeeding generations drained and developed
it. The name smelt of newly baked bread; it gradually
evolved itself into Garrison. They were one
of the fast disappearing families, who remained as
they began&mdash;modest and thankful. They brought
up their son with a sense of responsibility, as trustee
for the coming son. There were no girls as far
back as could be remembered; each family branch
had one son. Floyd&#8217;s father, &#8220;Jimmy&#8221; Garrison,
married a school marm. He became acquainted
with her in Boston. She was very poor, but descended
from <i>the</i> Aldens. Prudence Alden was a
pale silent girl with a hidden fountain of irrepressible
love in all its rare purity. Young Garrison&#8217;s
friends couldn&#8217;t see what <i>he</i> saw in her.</p>

<p>Garrison had never been in business; he disliked
the everlasting talk about money which was rapidly
becoming God under the title of the &#8220;Almighty&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
dollar. He had many acquaintances and one faithful
friend, Colonel Garland, a Southern gentleman,
who had made a reputation &#8220;up North&#8221; as a corporation
lawyer, when trusts were springing up over
night like toadstools. The Colonel retained his
sombrero, his soft accent, his passionate devotion to
a few friends, and many women. When Jimmy
Garrison put the administration of his estate into
Colonel Garland&#8217;s hands, it was intact, just as his
father had left it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us pull down those old hulks and build up
warehouses,&#8221; said the Colonel. Garrison refused
to consider that.</p>

<p>&#8220;The estate was not bought yesterday, for speculation.
It has always brought us enough to live on
modestly, and something over; if I get four per
cent., I&#8217;m well satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>In time, modern buildings were erected on both
sides of the Garrison &#8220;hulks,&#8221; which, although kept
clean and in repair, had to be rented below the
market value. Conservative policy has its good
side; many went under in the frenzy of over-building.
In such a young country the cult of silence,
material rest, creative thought were as yet unknown;
the man who did not create capital was considered
an idler; Garrison continued to the end of his peaceful,
worryless life, a gentleman.</p>

<p>The first realization of pain was the sudden death
of his beloved Prudence; he had to live for his boy
and looked about, seeking a sustaining force.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>He rigged up a workshop in the top of his house,
and took to modeling figures, which were very well
done&mdash;every-day people he had known, the little
Italian shoe boy, the newspaper woman, his friends,
idealized of course, his wife in every mood, his boy.
He was particularly successful with a smiling old
Irishman, a pipe in his mouth, a hod on his shoulder,
standing at the foot of a ladder looking upward.
He called that figure &#8220;the Ancestor,&#8221; which title
was a secret source of amusement to him, although
he was too good-natured to say <i>whose</i> ancestor.</p>

<p>When asked the inevitable question,</p>

<p>&#8220;What business are you in, Mr. Garrison?&#8221;</p>

<p>Garrison would answer gravely,</p>

<p>&#8220;I muddle in clay.&#8221;</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>The Steeles lived next door to the Garrisons in an
ugly high-stoop, four-story brick mansion, which
threw a dark shadow on one side of the little
garden, necessitating Garrison to move his flower-beds
away.</p>

<p>Martin was five years older than Floyd and
twenty years more experienced. He loved Floyd in
his way, but love was not an element of his nature.
Floyd looked up to him, as a little boy would to an
elder one who condescended to be his friend; he was
sorry for Martin because Mrs. Steele was only his
stepmother, that was what was wrong with him&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
never had a &#8220;real&#8221; mother. Mrs. Steele was born
Dolly Winthrop of Boston; she was very tall, very
thin, very straight, with small transparent ears lying
flat against her head. The only large thing about
her was her flow of language&mdash;that was tremendous.
Mrs. Steele&#8217;s &#8220;family tree&#8221; reposed on the parlor
table in a red velvet album&mdash;&#8220;reposed&#8221; is a very
inappropriate word, for she never gave the poor
thing any rest. She was constantly turning over its
pages, adding, multiplying, never subtracting, until
it fell quite to pieces, but she convinced the old New
Yorkers of her right to be one of them.</p>

<p>The &#8220;exclusives&#8221; of Massachusetts never forgave
Dolly Winthrop&#8217;s marriage with &#8220;that Steele man&#8221;
who was fat, florid, wordless, and a widower with a
child. There were still spots in the Union where
pedigree and culture were of more value than
&#8220;money&#8221;; but Dolly Winthrop had made her calculation
and it turned out a good bargain. Her husband
and his father devoted all their time to
business; they accumulated great wealth, and were
not perceptible in her richly woven society tapestry.
There was one she couldn&#8217;t wipe out&mdash;that terrible
boy Martin. She tried honestly to make something
of him, but he was not to be moulded. She took him
to her summer home in Nantucket. The Winthrop
Homestead had ship-lamps, a model of the <i>Mayflower</i>,
clocks that struck &#8220;bells&#8221;&mdash;numbered hours
were disdained; there were also stuffed seagulls
which Martin set up as skittles, and a tottering old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
sailor who took care of the garden and gave the
necessary atmosphere. Aunt Priscilla, Mrs. Steele&#8217;s
maiden sister, lived there all the year. In Nantucket,
Martin&#8217;s capacity of hatred found fertile
soil for expansion; he hated the ocean; its unceasing
roar fretted him; he thought of a big sea monster
in chains, writhing, howling, foaming at the mouth.
He hated Aunt Priscilla, who was Calvinist, Puritan,
Patriot, anti-everything else. She took unusual
pains to enlighten the &#8220;little savage&#8221; about the distinguished
pedigree of his stepmother&#8217;s family. One
day she read to him for three hours, in her correct
English &#8220;twang,&#8221; the history of those good old
Colonial times, when her direct ancestor was a Judge
in Salem. The boy&#8217;s eyes took on a glitter which
meant mischief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to be a Judge in them times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, you&#8217;d like to <i>have</i> been a Judge in
<i>those</i> times,&#8221; corrected Aunt Priscilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have been,&#8221; mumbled the boy.</p>

<p>Aunt Priscilla was delighted; at last she had
awakened the pride of ancestry in that little soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now tell me, dear, what would you <i>have done</i>
if you <i>had been</i> a Judge in Salem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d burn you.&#8221;</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>One day Floyd found out there was a mystery on
the top floor of the Steele house; it was Martin&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
fourteenth birthday. He invited Floyd to ice-cream
and cake. &#8220;Julie Gonzola was coming.&#8221; There
was plenty to eat, but Floyd lost his appetite looking
at little Julie sitting up on a high chair with all the
best things piled before her. She let Martin pile
them, but she didn&#8217;t touch them&mdash;she couldn&#8217;t, in a
strange house.</p>

<p>Toward evening the maid came to take her home.
The two boys stood at the window as she went past
enveloped in white furs, her little feet stepping out
firmly, her head erect.</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s eyes snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to marry Julie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin turned and swept the boy with a cold disdain
terrible in one so young. It hurt Floyd; he
remembered that look, years after. He said nothing,
but turned to go.</p>

<p>Martin stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay with me; I&#8217;m lonesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a touch of pathos in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, I&#8217;ll show you some family relics.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way to the garret, four stories high;
it was filled with old furniture, spinning wheels, oil
paintings&mdash;some wretchedly bad, others fairly good,
all with heavy gold frames; every piece was ticketed
with a name and date, in the different generations of
the family.</p>

<p>Then Martin became confidential.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you something, but don&#8217;t mention it to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
my mother. These things are all fakes; she haunts
the auction sales, she&#8217;s a good judge&mdash;she knows
what fits in, she&#8217;s got a whole lot more in storage.
We&#8217;re going to move away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd got a chill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! You were born here! You will never
leave your home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s mocking laugh rang out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re too sentimental. She&#8217;s not going to
sell the house; that wouldn&#8217;t look well. She&#8217;s going
to fill it with our &#8216;family&#8217; antiques, and donate it to
the city as an &#8216;Art Museum.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was struck silent as usual by Martin&#8217;s terrible
lack of heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody singing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin looked troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, there&#8217;s nobody up here. Let&#8217;s go
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew Floyd into the hall; there was a door
opposite.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> somebody singing&mdash;a man&#8217;s voice, broken,
harsh, rising, and falling in a strange inflection.</p>

<p>Martin, with a look of fear mingled with shame,
tried to draw Floyd downstairs. A heavy fist on
the door pushed it open. A man of gigantic stature
rushed out. At first glance, Floyd saw only a pair
of wonderful mocking eyes&mdash;Martin&#8217;s eyes; there
was a strange light in them. The man was mad.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Martin sprang at him, tried to push him back into
the room. He was too strong for the boy. Then
Martin coaxed him. Was that Martin&#8217;s voice, so
loving, so sweet? He spoke in a foreign tongue,
strange to Floyd. The old man looked curiously at
Floyd, then said &#8220;Grutsie&#8221; and bowed respectfully.
He learnt afterwards &#8220;Grutsie&#8221; was Swiss dialect
for &#8220;I greet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man had huge hands, knotty, sun-dried; the
open flannel shirt revealed a chest covered with thick
hair. He had an enormous head, and a thick white
mane falling over his eyes. He wore corduroy
trousers to the knees and a pair of high deerskin
boots with heavy nails in the soles. He paced unceasingly.
The floor was covered with indentures.
Martin shut the door carefully, took down a harness
with bells which hung on the wall, threw it over the
old man&#8217;s head, cracking a heavy whip, yelling at
the top of his voice, lashing him with sharp quick
blows. The old man growled like a beaten beast;
the whip hurt him; the young devil was strong; in
the sensual intoxication of brute force, they forgot
the horrified boy looking on.</p>

<p>The door was flung open. Mrs. Steele stood
there, deathly pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that noise, you&#8217;ll rouse the neighbors; how
dare you bring Floyd up here?&#8221; She grasped Martin&#8217;s
hand, pushing him toward the door.</p>

<p>The old man slunk into a corner; he was evidently
afraid of her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>&#8220;Let me go!&#8221; roared Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll be punished for this.&#8221; Then a
struggle followed; Floyd never forgot it. She held
him with her small strong hands; he bit them. She
struck him across the mouth; he kicked her. She
cried out with pain, but she held him fast. Floyd,
with a terrified cry, rushed down the stairs and out
of the house.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Mr. Garrison was working at his clay figures,
thinking how much Floyd was growing like his
mother; he had her sensitive, ideal nature. The
boy&#8217;s love for Julie might be a great blessing; it
might be the contrary.... He would like to live
long enough to see that beautiful little girl a woman.</p>

<p>Floyd broke into the room, sobbing out what he
had seen. Mr. Garrison quieted him, and told him
the story of the Steele family, as he had it from his
friend, Colonel Garland.</p>

<p>The old man in the garret was Martin&#8217;s grandfather,
a Swiss peasant, who had come to America
in the steerage, with his boy, a child of four. He
obtained a position as waiter in a downtown cafe,
and the boy grew up in the streets. In ten years
the father was head waiter in a Fifth Avenue hotel,
frequented by Wall Street men. He never spoke
more than a waiter&#8217;s English. His boy came out of
school with a correct knowledge of grammar, but
was silent, uncouth, unfriendly. Waiting for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
father one night, in the kitchen of the hotel, he
noticed one of the dishwashers, a very young blonde
girl, crying bitterly. He questioned her; she told
him she was Swiss, like himself, that she had been
in America a short time, and was very unhappy.
He comforted her. When it became no longer possible
to conceal her condition, he married her; this
was a bitter blow to the old waiter, who had, in
those twenty years of deprivation, saved one hundred
thousand dollars, and wanted to make a gentleman
out of his son. Fate favored him. The girl
died giving birth to a boy. The doctors could not
understand the case; she was a very strong, healthy
peasant; but Martin in a burst of anguish insisted
she had died of homesickness.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrison explained to Floyd the word
&#8220;nostalgia,&#8221; originating with the Swiss, which meant
their longing for their native soil when absent; the
pain is intolerable, ending often in death. Floyd
was very sorry for the poor peasant mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old man started in the hotel supply business;
he rented one of my shanties on the river
front. The firm is still there. I used to see old
Steele walking up and down before that sign on the
door. &#8216;Martin Steele and Son.&#8217; I could never make
friends with young Steele; he was sullen, wordless,
and seemed to be out of his element. Then they
bought the house next door and lived there a solitary
life. Your mother was sorry for lonely little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Martin, and had him often in here to play with you.
When Dolly Winthrop came from Boston to visit
us, we saw she had her eye on the rich widower.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she got him,&#8221; said Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, unfortunately for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what happened then, father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She dominated those poor men with her culture,
shamed them with her pedigree, crushed them with
her contempt. The old man fell into bad habits,
drank to excess. His mind failed; people spoke of
an illiterate grandfather in the house, but visitors
never saw him.&#8221;...</p>

<p>After that episode in the garret, Mrs. Steele&#8217;s
patience with the boy gave out. She insisted on sending
him to a strict military school. He&#8217;d come home
in the summertime when she was in Nantucket, and
prowl about the city during the long evenings. In
Twelfth Street, seemingly deserted, he&#8217;d run up and
down stoops, pulling bells; then the &#8220;spring rollers&#8221;
would fly up, and he&#8217;d count the genteel poor who
were sweltering in New York; when he grew too old
for such pranks, he would spend his evenings in the
garret watching his father and grandfather playing
a strange game of cards called &#8220;Tarac&#8221; and listening
to their jargon. He learnt the game and the
jargon, with great rapidity.</p>

<p>His father, who was always afraid of troubling
his wife, died suddenly at his desk; then the old
man&#8217;s mind bolted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>Mrs. Steele in a burst of confidence said one day
to Mr. Garrison:</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be very wicked of me, but I pray to God
not to let him live long.&#8221; Her prayer was answered;
unrighteous prayers usually are. After that,
Mrs. Steele closed the house and went to live in
Boston; later she sent Martin to Harvard. Floyd
wrote him several times, but his letters were not answered;
it was many years before the two boys met
again.</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>Floyd didn&#8217;t go to college&mdash;his father couldn&#8217;t
spare him, but he gave him a good classical education,
under the best professors. Mr. Garrison
wasn&#8217;t training his son for business; he wanted him
to be a man of culture. They took long walks into
the country, with Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow
for companions. Thoreau was revolutionary, a disjointed
mind. The historical novels then in vogue
were read and reread, also foreign literature.
Realism, Nihilism, and all the other isms were
looked into and studied as the result of &#8220;unhealthy&#8221;
European conditions. Mr. Garrison moulded his
son in good clay.</p>

<p>Sunday was the happiest day in the week for
Floyd. He would slip out of the little Dutch Reform
church around the corner, restless when the
pastor strung out his sermon fearing he should miss
Julie, who went to the Cathedral. Lately, he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
fortunate to find her there without her mother.</p>

<p>Good Friday,&mdash;the Cathedral draped in black.
The sorrow-laden music, the odor of incense gave
him a sensuous feeling of emotion. Julie came down
the aisle, her prayer book pressed against her heart,
her eyes seeking things beyond this world. It
seemed to the impressionable youth a desecration to
&#8220;bring her back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at the sad faces and bowed heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful after so many centuries, this
sense of personal loss in the people; life would be
unbearable without the Easter joy, the lilies, the
Resurrection.&#8221;</p>

<p>His words sounded poetical to him as he spoke;
he was very young. Julie smiled; she seemed less
divine out in the sunlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel that way, but Mother is ill and insists
on my going; an empty pew doesn&#8217;t look well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was shocked. He had read in the &#8220;great&#8221;
writers those traditional truisms we repeat mechanically.
&#8220;The woman&#8217;s emotional nature endows her
with the gift of Faith; she has held aloft the Banner
of Religion in the great struggle against skepticism.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked down Fifth Avenue. There was an
expression he had never seen in Julie&#8217;s calm face,
an indefinable something, as if she had pulled down
a veil over her eyes. Before her house, she didn&#8217;t
give him her hand as usual. She was looking expectantly
at the upper windows; he followed her
gaze. She waved her hand, smilingly; there was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
face looking out; the light made it transparent like
yellow wax. In a moment it was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t I seen him before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t come downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you for some time, but
Mother said it was nobody&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything that concerns you is of vital interest to
me. You know that, don&#8217;t you, Julie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She braced her shoulders, looking him straight in
the face; she was very proud. He liked that; most
girls held themselves too cheaply.</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandfather doesn&#8217;t come down because he
disapproves of the way we live. He says we have
sold our souls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are Jews. You needn&#8217;t come here again.&#8221;
She went quickly up the steps and entered the house
without looking back.</p>

<p>Floyd walked down the street towards his house.
He was terribly excited; socially, he had never
known any Jews. He had seen some dark fellows
who were wonders at mathematics and chess; boys
of their creed were limited in numbers in the colleges,
kept out of social clubs, but somehow they
managed to filter through everywhere. What did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
it mean? How could the Gonzolas be Jews? They
were Catholics.</p>

<p>A young man came towards him, of striking appearance,
with a touch of something about him not
American. He put out his hand laughingly to
Floyd. It was Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You deserve it. Why didn&#8217;t you answer my
letters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I had no time; they kept my nose to the
grindstone. I walked off with the prizes just to
spite Aunt Priscilla. Mother is very proud of me;
she calls me &#8216;my son&#8217; now.&#8221; There was the old
mocking glitter in his eye; he had not changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry with me.&#8221; He took Floyd&#8217;s
arm. Martin could be very winning when he wanted
to. &#8220;You&#8217;ve grown into a fine, handsome fellow,
with the unmistakable brand of the aristocrat;
strong with the women, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As gone as ever on Julie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Floyd shot out a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the history of the Gonzolas?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s answer came back as quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they are baptized Jews.&#8221;</p>

<p>A red streak flushed Floyd&#8217;s forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin leaned against the gate, revelling in
Floyd&#8217;s agitation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>&#8220;The Gonzolas go back to the time when the
Church in Spain commenced war on the Jews; thousands
of them were baptized, but they still practiced
their religion in secret. Romantic, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; terrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of the Catholic Gonzolas became Bishops,
Cardinals, and high state officials on account of their
wealth and culture, but others, true to their Faith,
fled to Amsterdam, where they founded the great
banking house which spread its branches all over
Europe. Julie&#8217;s grandfather was a handsome, dashing
fellow. He married in the family&mdash;they all do&mdash;but
he had an affair with an Austrian actress
which lasted for years. Their son was brought up
in the religion of his mother who became pious with
age and as expiation, dedicated him to the Church.
She died before he was ordained, and Gonzola, naturally
opposed, easily persuaded the boy against it&mdash;and
sent him to America where he took the family
name. The bank he founded here was successful;
he became very rich. This bastard was Julie&#8217;s
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are Catholics, not Jews,&#8221; insisted
Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the joke of it,&#8221; laughed Martin. &#8220;An
ironic witticism, an impish trick of Fate. Pedro
came with letters from his father, to an old friend,
Joseph Abravanel, an orthodox Jew, a fanatic, of
Spanish origin with infernal pride of race. He
boasts his ancestors provided money to help Columbus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
fit out his ship. Pedro fell desperately in love
with Ruth Abravanel; those Spanish Jewesses are
handsome, but most of them are old maids, because
they won&#8217;t marry the Germans whom they look
down upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That old man I saw today at the window?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Joseph Abravanel, Mrs. Gonzola&#8217;s father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you know all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard it scores of times from Julie. The
crossing of the races interests me; I&#8217;ve got my own
ideas about that. I&#8217;m waiting to see how it comes
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s shocking for people to change their religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin laughed a bit too loud, Floyd thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the difference? Who believes in it anyhow;
do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd evaded a direct answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We practice many things out of respect for our
parents and our social position.&#8221; He was undeniably
well brought up.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I like about Julie,&#8221; said Martin.
&#8220;In spite of everything, she remains a true
daughter of her race. I like in her the sensuousness
of the Oriental; oh, I don&#8217;t mean sexness&mdash;that may
also be there latent; I hope it is. I see in her the
Shulamite maiden who gets up from her couch at
night and goes to seek her lover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about Julie? You&#8217;ve been
away so long.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a week in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was angry, injured. &#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ve been
writing to her all this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose she was very glad to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I was mad to see her. I couldn&#8217;t
wait; I went straight there.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a look of passion in Martin&#8217;s face.
Floyd hated him. He turned and entered the gate.
Martin was at his elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming in to see your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>At dinner Martin kept up a fire of witty criticisms.
Floyd was silent, preoccupied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your house has been shut up for some time.
Where is your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Nantucket. She loves the shores where her
ancestors landed, in sailing vessels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother&#8217;s pride of nationality is quite natural;
I also feel it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t parade it. My mother makes capital
out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; insisted Mr. Garrison, &#8220;you are an American;
you were born here; you know no other home.
English is your mother tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but race is stronger than language. My
people were Swiss peasants. I may look and speak
like a gentleman, but sometimes the lout in me is
hard to suppress.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence. Mr. Garrison changed the
subject.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>&#8220;Are you going into your father&#8217;s business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I&#8217;d smash it with my mad notions.&#8221; Then
he flashed a bright look. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been daubing in oil;
it&#8217;s the only thing that interests me. I shall go to
Paris to study, if I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Garrison was all animation. &#8220;That&#8217;s very
good news. You will live; you&#8217;re young, strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knows&mdash;America is going into the wholesale
slaughter business. She needs butchers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll be pushed into the War.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was all attention. He spoke with a thrill
in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it comes, we Americans will not be wanting
in patriotism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin didn&#8217;t seem to feel the insinuation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patriotism, bah! Who cares? We&#8217;ll have to
go; if we don&#8217;t, they&#8217;ll shoot us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Garrison was sitting with his head in his
hands. Floyd arose and went to him. He had been
failing for some time, complained of dizziness. Dr.
McClaren couldn&#8217;t discover any organic trouble.
Floyd, who watched every change of expression,
saw him grow pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&mdash;you don&#8217;t feel well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes!&mdash;but I think I&#8217;ll go and rest awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose from the chair, staggered; Martin caught
him, carried him up, and laid him on the bed.</p>

<p>Floyd bent over his father, frantically begging
him to speak. The stricken man raised his hand in
a mute blessing, then closed his eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>To Floyd, the next few weeks were chaotic; time,
space, light, darkness lost all meaning. Martin
never left him during those black days; always
there in the sleepless horror of the night, to read to
him, to go out and pace the streets with him, when
the walls became insupportable. He would have
gone under without Martin.</p>

<p>The funeral over, the will read by Colonel Garland,
the sole executor, the few distant relatives
from far and near come and gone, Floyd took up
again the routine of life. Mr. Garrison had left
everything to his son, whom he hoped would marry
young and be happy in the old home, leaving it to
<i>his</i> son after him. The Garrisons had always lived
well, in a modest way, befitting their position. He
was sure Floyd would keep up the family tradition.
He left money to many philanthropic institutions
and to his club where he and his father before him
had spent many pleasant hours and where he hoped
his boy would sit many years after him.</p>

<p>Colonel Garland, commenting on the will to
Martin, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;A sane, righteous testament. He was a good
man....&#8221;</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>In the months that followed, Floyd saw little of
Julie. She called several times with her mother,
who was very sweet and amiable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>&#8220;I hope when you feel more like seeing people
you&#8217;ll come to us often,&#8221; said Mrs. Gonzola.</p>

<p>Floyd looked at Julie, who smiled at him, and returned
the pressure of his hand. Martin was a
great deal at the Gonzolas&#8217;, but he didn&#8217;t mention
that to Floyd. One Sunday afternoon Mrs. Gonzola
came into the parlor, Martin was sitting very
close to Julie, reading in rich passionate tones a love
poem by Oscar Wilde; Julie started up and Martin
left, but all that day she couldn&#8217;t meet her mother&#8217;s
clairvoyant eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like him, Julie. He&#8217;s no class. He was
an unmannerly boy and he&#8217;s a dangerous man. I&#8217;ve
told James to say you&#8217;re out, the next time he calls.
If you meet him accidentally, avoid him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother,&#8221; said Julie. After that she saw
him often with the assistance of a sympathetic
French teacher, whose room was post-office and rendezvous
for the lovers.</p>

<p>Martin gave Julie glimpses of &#8220;life.&#8221; He took
her to all kinds of strange places&mdash;a chop suey
restaurant, with its unpalatable dishes, soft lights,
and insidious Chinamen; a dancing cafe which at
that time was not supposed to be a place for young
ladies&mdash;but best of all was Hippolyte.</p>

<p>Hippolyte&#8217;s Parlor flaunted on Fifth Avenue. It
had a magnificent plate glass show window, fitted
with Circassian walnut, in which was one red feather
fan on a cushion of Nile green velvet, one jeweled
comb, and a Pierrot costumed in black silk with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
large white ruff, his face wonderful in its languid
perversity. Up the side street there was a private
door which opened halfway to let in ladies heavily
veiled. Julie&#8217;s ambition was to see what was behind
that fascinating door; today it is no longer a mystery.
In the Middle Ages, Hippolyte would have
been a miracle man summoned to a fair Venetian
to deepen the red of her hair, the rose in her cheeks,
the marvel of her eyes&mdash;selling for a purse of gold,
charms to rob a rival of a coveted lover. Times have
not changed, nor people; only appearances.</p>

<p>Martin took Julie into the shop one day and introduced
her to Hippolyte, who pronounced her
&#8220;ravissante&#8221;; thereupon Martin bought a costly box
of perfume. Julie was afraid to take it home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll settle that,&#8221; laughed Martin, and poured it
over her, then they ran around the reservoir to get
rid of the odor. Mrs. Gonzola noticed it, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>Julie was standing at the window waiting for her
mother. Her gloved hands impatiently agitating
the curtains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, the car is here. I shall be late for my
music lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice answering from upstairs was nervous,
trembling. &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible for me to go with you
today; I&#8217;m not well.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flash illumined Julie&#8217;s face, but her voice was
under perfect control. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the upper window, her mother watched her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
music-roll in hand, stepping into the car. Mrs.
Gonzola realized more and more acutely that her
lovely child was developing into a beautiful woman;
there was no feeling of joyful pride. Horrible,
agonizing fear stopped the current of her blood.</p>

<p>Julie, alone in the car, drew a long breath. The
pink of her lips turned red, the color slowly overflowing
into her cheeks. She pulled the cord, asked
the chauffeur in her soft, sensuous voice to stop at
the nearest drug store; there she telephoned, then
drove to the house of her professor. She was a
gifted pianiste; she played with a sure, velvety touch,
surmounting with ease all technical difficulties. The
professor went into ecstasies about the beautiful
child-woman with &#8220;Eternal Love in her fingers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The car turned into the Park. Martin was walking
up and down by the little lake. He hated to
wait. She never kept an appointment; if she didn&#8217;t
come today he was through. His heart leaped when
he saw her. The girl had a terrible power over him.
She said smilingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go across town and up Riverside Drive
for an hour. Then I&#8217;ll drop you at the club.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sped along in the car. He pulled down the
shades, drew off her gloves, tearing the buttons in
his haste, crushed her two hands in his moist hot
ones, spoke quickly, panting with excitement:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought it all out. I&#8217;m going to your
mother tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; gasped Julie. &#8220;Write to her first.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>&#8220;I have written to her, as politely as I knew how.
I told her I loved you and wanted you to be my
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>He read the answer, his voice shaking with anger
and wounded pride:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have no words to reply to your impertinent letter. Julie will
not marry until she is of age. You are not the man I consider
worthy of her. You take it for granted that she is willing. I
know her better. She will not consent. I warn you not to molest
her with further attentions, and consider the matter closed.</p></div>

<p>She crouched in the corner, speechless.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will blame me. She will say I encouraged
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but marriage! I&#8217;m too young yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pressed her to him with a force that left her
helpless. He would show her haughty mother who
was the master. With his face pressed against hers,
he talked, expostulated, begged, threatened to kill
himself, kissing her again and again, until she gave
in. She would do anything, everything he asked of
her, but he must give her twenty-four hours to win
over her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you fail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, I will go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie! Your mother will influence you against
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one can do that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>&#8220;You are mine; I will not give you up.&#8221; He
swore an oath, which made her shudder. With a
quiver of terrible joy, she put her arms around his
neck. Her lips sought his.</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>Every afternoon, Floyd Garrison occupied a deep
chair in the window of his club on upper Fifth Avenue&mdash;a
privilege inherited by the law of precedence,
from his father and grandfather. His great-grandfather
was one of the founders of the original club-house
which was downtown&mdash;an old building with
raftered ceilings, wooden models of ships, and a
portrait of Peter with the game leg.</p>

<p>In time the &#8220;youngsters&#8221; of 1850 moved uptown,
refurnished in plush, and became very exclusive.
They kept people out for lack of pedigree, or difference
of religious conviction.</p>

<p>A young scion of the new-rich said enviously to
Floyd:</p>

<p>&#8220;I spend much more on my tailor than you do;
you can afford to wear your old clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd smiled. He took in the young man&mdash;a
fighting figure, physically strong, eager, on the alert,
with gambler&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never had to sweat blood for money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expression was coarse, but it threw a mental
picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve never &#8216;sweated blood&#8217; for a living.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say a living, I said money. Any idiot
can make a living. A man must have money and
lots of it to be anybody; it&#8217;s a hot game.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>Floyd wondered if money could buy his armchair
in the club-window. He was sure it couldn&#8217;t, but he
was a gentlemanly young fellow; he wouldn&#8217;t hurt
the man&#8217;s feelings. Destiny had been more than
kind to him. He wasn&#8217;t grateful; he took life&#8217;s
favors as a matter of course. In fact, he never gave
it any thought. When his father died, sorrow
blunted the keen edge of existence; now after a year
he was waking up. His heart&#8217;s desire was Julie
Gonzola. He had no fear; it was the eve of fulfillment.</p>

<p>Sitting there in the club-window, idly watching the
traffic, he saw the Gonzola car. Julie was inside
with Martin. They stopped at the entrance. Martin
sprang out; Floyd waited for him with a pleasant
touch of expectancy. Now there would be a long
talk about Julie.</p>

<p>He came swinging in, his dark face quivering with
excitement. Floyd didn&#8217;t take Martin seriously; his
unpleasant emotional nature gave his actions a
touch of exaggeration, which repelled Floyd, with
his calm, undisturbed nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why all this excitement? What&#8217;s happened
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke laughingly. Martin was always getting
into some transient mix-up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>&#8220;I may as well tell you, you&#8217;ll have to know it.
I&#8217;ve asked Julie to marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was on his feet, hurt, angry; Martin had
listened hours to what he called &#8220;love ravings&#8221;
about Julie, knowing he was waiting only for his
year of mourning to expire. It was treachery. They
faced each other&mdash;Martin had an air of triumph,
but he turned away from Floyd&#8217;s accusing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve given her twenty-four hours to prepare her
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll not consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, won&#8217;t she? I know the way to make her.&#8221;
Then he walked away.</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>Julie crouched in the corner of the car, her dark
pupils contracting, dilating; she was going home to
prepare her mother. The contempt in that letter
she had written to Martin was awful, but she had
promised and she braced herself for the fight. She
was used to battles, bitter, uncompromising; used
to the struggle of antagonistic spirits; but she had
always been kept out of all that agony, pampered,
spoilt, worshipped by her mother, indulged by her
grandfather&mdash;and now she must fight them both,
and she would. If they stood out against Martin,
she would keep her word and go away with him;
this was her determination. She stepped out of the
car and found her mother waiting for her in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
hall; she knew what was coming. Mrs. Gonzola led
the way upstairs to her bedroom&mdash;watched Julie
take off her hat and coat, and smooth down her
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been meeting this man
without my knowledge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Martin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you forbade him the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the first time in your life that you have
openly disobeyed me. Why did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love him, Mother, and he loves me, and I am
going to marry him.&#8221; She had rehearsed it in the
car.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gonzola implored her not to marry that
&#8220;ruffian&#8221; who had intrigued to get her affection.
No man of honor would have acted like that. He
was not the man for her&mdash;she was too young to
realize it&mdash;she would hate him in the end. She
begged, entreated her to wait a year. Julie burst
into convulsed sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t wait, Mother&mdash;I&#8217;ve been through all
that with him. Mother! Mother! Don&#8217;t stop it,
don&#8217;t, I <i>must</i> marry him! I <i>must</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gonzola gave a terrible cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean&mdash;tell me! Why must you
marry him? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because! because!&mdash;he says he&#8217;ll kill me if I
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Gonzola warned her of the anger of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Father Cabello, who would never marry her to an
atheist, a heretic&mdash;warned her of her grandfather&#8217;s
curses (and the old Jew could curse); she heard
him again, as he stood over her on the day of <i>her</i>
marriage, pouring out his anger. His curses had
come true in her wretched life, and this disobedient
child&mdash;she was suffering as he had suffered that day&mdash;but
now the old man was her only hope; Julie
worshipped him. She threatened her with his anger,
the wrath of the great Jewish God who does not
forgive, who would bring down punishment upon
her and her children&#8217;s children.</p>

<p>The girl lay flat on the ground, quivering with
horror, fear&mdash;then she became quite cold and stiff,
and fell into a cataleptic trance, which lasted an
hour. Mrs. Gonzola undressed her, put her into
bed, and lay beside her, holding her close. The girl
gradually grew warm, and smiled at her mother.
The spasm of obstinacy over, she was again the submissive
child. She would sacrifice herself and
Martin, it was her duty; she became calm, almost
cheerful, as was usual after those spells.</p>

<p>She wanted her mother to dress her as she did
when she was a child. Mrs. Gonzola was happy;
her life was bound up in this girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look so beautiful, Julie; go and show grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gonzola stood at the bottom of the stairs
till Julie went in where Joseph Abravanel sat reading,
unconscious of the tragedy which had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
enacted below. He blessed her, called her a good
child, the hope of his life. Then she and her mother
dined in the big room with its dark Spanish tapestry
and gold plate; it was a festive occasion. Mrs. Gonzola
praised Floyd and his devotion to the memory
of his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;You always liked him best as a child, didn&#8217;t you,
Julie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mother&mdash;I&mdash;I liked them <i>both</i>&mdash;&#8221; Then
the fear came again of Martin!</p>

<p>&#8220;He will kill me, Mother. I&#8217;m afraid of him,
afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie, I have no strength to fight for you. Marry
Floyd; he is a simple honest boy. He has always
loved you.&#8221;</p>

<p>To her mother&#8217;s great amazement Julie answered
in slow deliberate tones&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be the only way to save myself&mdash;but
it must be at once. I mustn&#8217;t have time to think
about it&mdash;or I couldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>Floyd went home early that afternoon, stopping
before the little gate. He had taken great pains
with his garden. The lawn was velvety smooth;
beds of flowers were banked up against the porch;
geraniums bloomed in boxes at the windows. The
polished brass knocker, the soft white curtain, gave
the little house an atmosphere of purity, cleanliness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Passers stopped to admire it; they felt that &#8220;nice&#8221;
people lived there.</p>

<p>Floyd shook off a sick feeling; anger nauseated
him. The knocker gave out a musical call. The
door was opened by a bright little Japanese boy&mdash;the
old servants had gradually left during the
lonely year of mourning. There was nothing
changed in the house&mdash;the wood fire lit, the candles
on the table set for two; he saw his father at
the head of it. After dinner the boy brought his
slippers and velvet house jacket. He stretched himself
in a big chair and lit his pipe. He loved his
pipe&mdash;that was the Knickerbocker strain in him; he
smoked it with reverence as the old Dutchmen did&mdash;in
the days when pipes were longer and tobacco better.
He loved to sit before the wood fire, and listen
to its hissing, crackling, singing; he thought of his
mother&#8217;s ancestors, those sturdy Pioneers in their
cabins, piling on the logs, bolting their iron shutters
against the howling wolves outside, who devoured
the bodies and cracked the bones of men. The
Puritans are gone, but the wolves are still with us;
they eat the soul and sow wolf seed.</p>

<p>Then he thought how his father had planned his
life for him, just as he had laid out his garden. It
had not occurred to him that his son&#8217;s life must be
different from his own. His father&#8217;s time was far
away. Today things change with a flash&mdash;there is
no more &#8220;slow development&#8221;&mdash;a fire!&mdash;a storm,
lightning, ruins! He was a fool to be so sure of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Julie; she had been very sympathetic in his year of
mourning. He took it for love&mdash;Martin, that vulgarian,
with his family history! He never had the
slightest suspicion of what was going on between
them. He&#8217;d been a blind fool.</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet; the clock struck ten.
Twenty-four hours to prepare her mother. Why
hadn&#8217;t she said &#8220;No&#8221; at once and put an end to it?
She couldn&#8217;t want to marry him; it was unthinkable,
but he never knew quite what she did think. When
he said, &#8220;A penny for your thoughts,&#8221; she grew very
serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;My thoughts are only for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He became impatient. Why make the thing so
complicated? It was simple enough; they both
wanted her and they&#8217;d have to fight for her as they
did as boys. They never knew which of them she
liked.</p>

<p>The telephone rang. He took up the receiver.
It was Mrs. Gonzola&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it you, Floyd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you come over for a few moments? It&#8217;s
late, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood before the mirror in the hall. It reflected
a young man, clean-shaven, straight brows, eyes deep
blue, almost black, the mouth set with suppressed
pain; that was all the image gave out&mdash;nothing of
the unsounded depths. The narcotic of ease and inherited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
aloofness had kept the lion of character
sleeping.</p>

<p>Passing the Dillon house, Floyd noticed vaguely
a sign &#8220;For Sale.&#8221; Tom Dillon had inherited a
large fortune which his father made in whiskey; he
had boasted he would drink up the well-stocked cellar
before he got rid of the house. It was illuminated
tonight; he heard music and loud laughter;
Tom was on the job.</p>

<p>In the parlor of the Gonzola mansion the butler
pressed a button which lit up the unaccountable glass
prisms of the electrified fixture; it was a familiar
room. As a boy, its grandeur had awed him; when
he grew older, he thought it old-fashioned, but he
didn&#8217;t want to see it changed. He knew little of
the other part of the house, excepting the dining-room
which was in old leather, heavy, dark. He
had always spoken with superiority of the &#8220;charming
Spanish atmosphere&#8221; of the room. Tonight it
struck him differently. &#8220;What an ignorant fool he
was.&#8221; A man who mentally kicks himself for being
all kinds of a fool is often awakening to wisdom.</p>

<p>The floor was parquet, smooth and polished.
There were Oriental rugs and deep armchairs, upholstered
in Turkish, and a broad divan with wonderful
silk rugs thrown over it. Fur animals lay
about with enormous heads and glassy eyes. The
window hangings were of costly lace. He had often
looked at that bronze figure in a corner; tonight it
spoke to him. It was the Moses of Michael Angelo&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
noble head with a rippling, flowing beard. The
walls were covered with family portraits in gilt
frames, turning old gold with age. He had said
with authority &#8220;they are Van Dykes.&#8221; Now he
noticed signed names unknown to him, probably
young foreign artists. He stood before a portrait
of Pedro Gonzola, Julie&#8217;s grandfather, painted in
Amsterdam, after a ball costume. A very handsome
young cavalier in black velvet with white lace
falling over his long, tapering fingers&mdash;he thought
of Martin&#8217;s coarse hands; no, the room was not
Spanish.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gonzola came in; she, too, took on a new
significance; a woman of fifty, small, sinuous, with
pale eyelids, forehead, lips; the process of Time had
almost washed out the human face which had been,
even at its best, but a soft water-color.</p>

<p>Tonight Floyd seemed to see within that white
Image. Past struggles, like smothered flames,
flashed up again momentarily. Her English was
perfect&mdash;so academic it sounded foreign; born in
New York, taught by professors, she spoke like one.
She had tried to bring Julie up that way, but
changed conditions were too strong for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Floyd, I am in a terrible dilemma. Martin has
asked Julie to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to draw away her hands, but Floyd held
them fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your decision means everything to me.&#8221; Floyd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
put his arm around her; he had known her all his
life. She clung to him; there were tears in her voice,
but her eyes were dry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie told you of our ancestry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it make any difference?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should it?&#8221;</p>

<p>An evasive answer. Why didn&#8217;t he make it
simple, and say &#8220;No&#8221;?</p>

<p>&#8220;Some people are prejudiced, but you have no
family ties, and are not religious. I don&#8217;t want
Julie to marry Martin, he&#8217;s vulgar; they are peasants,
common cattle drivers; his grandfather was a
waiter&mdash;I can&#8217;t think of it, it&#8217;s too horrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd tried to be fair.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if Julie likes him better&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She does not; I&#8217;m sure of it. She is very impressionable.
Martin has a kind of brute force; you
know him. He&#8217;ll talk her into it. It will be a terrible
misfortune for her; it will ruin her life! I
must make it impossible; I must!&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was speechless with excitement. She had
her arms around him, clinging to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie is a strange girl, at the mercy of inherited
instincts&mdash;she will be safe with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why did she say that? What was wrong with
Julie? Floyd began to take Julie&#8217;s part against her
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gonzola, be calm, I beg of you. You know
I have wanted Julie all my life; you know I want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
her now. If she loves Martin better, what&mdash;what&mdash;can
I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, she will tell you herself,&#8221; Mrs. Gonzola
glided out of the room. Floyd wiped his forehead.
What did it all mean? Why was she so afraid of
Martin? What was he doing there, anyhow?
Martin had been open with him, now <i>he</i> was conspiring
with her mother. No, he would do nothing
underhand. He would give Martin a chance
to get his answer as agreed. Julie must be free
to choose.</p>

<p>She stood in the doorway. He wanted to tell her
what was in his mind, but she didn&#8217;t give him time.
She came straight to him, put her arms around his
neck; her soft body intoxicated him. His heart&#8217;s
desire realized&mdash;Julie his wife; he couldn&#8217;t let her
go, he kissed her again and again. She laughed and
said in her soft, sensuous voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, don&#8217;t eat me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s forever, Julie, forever?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stammered out the words. He was terribly
excited, poor lad. She grew very serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;it is forever.&#8221; Then she cried and he
tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a great deal of excitement today. Go
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She let him kiss her again. He went unsteadily
like a soberly inclined man who had rushed violently
into an orgy of liquor. It was dawn when he slipped
quietly out of his house and dropped a letter to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Martin into the post-box, he had written everything,
just how it happened.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The only thing that clouds my indescribable happiness is the thought
that you may resent my not giving you your chance, but it was out of
my hands. When Mrs. Gonzola called me tonight, I had no idea of what
was awaiting me. My happiness came to me. I cannot let it go.</p></div>

<p>He expected no answer to his letter. It came by
return mail:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is nothing to be angry about; I would have done the same in
your place. I would take her away from you now, if it were possible,
but&mdash;don&#8217;t be uneasy, she doesn&#8217;t care enough for me. I don&#8217;t think
she&#8217;s insane about you, but you are the safer proposition. You won&#8217;t see
me for some time.</p></div>

<p>Martin had a way of disappearing when things
went against him. Floyd read the letter once more.
&#8220;The safer proposition.&#8221; Of course, she would be
safe with him; he was too happy to let the significance
of a word worry him. He slowly tore the letter
in little pieces, and said nothing to Julie about it.</p>

<p>The next evening, he went over to dine with the
Gonzolas. Mrs. Gonzola had asked him quietly not
to come during the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie needs time to calm down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calm down?&#8221; laughed Floyd. &#8220;It&#8217;s too early
for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is quite exhausted. She must get used to the
idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not exhausting to him to get used to happiness.
It came natural to think of Julie as &#8220;my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
dear wife.&#8221; He saw many, many years ahead. As
they grew old they would get fonder of each other,
like his mother and father. A pang shot through
him; if they were alive now! He had not &#8220;lived&#8221;
like other men; he had waited for the one woman.
The close contact was intoxicating, leaving him incapable
of logical reasoning. He waited impatiently
for the evening.</p>

<p>Julie stood under the big chandelier; her soft
white gown with a touch of red velvet seemed a part
of her flexible body; a filet of it was drawn over her
forehead. Her full red lips were a splash of color
in her pale face. She came quite naturally to him;
Floyd&#8217;s heart beat furiously. Mrs. Gonzola looked
regal in black lace, relieved by a huge diamond
brooch set in old silver. She approved of Floyd; he
was a gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father lives with us. Julie has probably told
you; I want her to take you up to see him. Don&#8217;t
speak of your engagement yet. Julie will break it to
him gradually, but I want him to know you, and I
am sure he will love you as we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>How gracious she was; it was like the condescension
of a Queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Break it to him,&#8221; as if it were bad news. Floyd
felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Julie led the way up to the fourth floor. They
entered a very large room with mullion windows;
one, at the extreme end, of yellow glass. He was
conscious of warmth, a glory of golden sunlight, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
odor of a hothouse, many palms. Under a tropical
tree with enormous leaves spread out like an umbrella
sat a man with a black silk skull cap on his
head. He was absorbed in his book. He did not raise
his eyes. Floyd at a first glance caught the impression
of age, because of a long thick white beard, falling
in waves, turning up at the edges in curls, which
reminded him of Michael Angelo&#8217;s Moses, but <i>this</i>
statue lived. Julie spoke very respectfully. She
seemed in awe of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandfather, I&#8217;ve brought Floyd Garrison to see
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He arose and came toward Floyd. He wore a
long black silk coat reaching to his ankles, with velvet
collar, cuffs, and slippers. His feet were very
small, his hands like a woman&#8217;s; the voice which
came from that frail body was clear, penetrating.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Joseph Abravanel.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were young. Floyd felt himself being
measured and weighed, but that didn&#8217;t disturb him;
he had no secrets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all about you, Floyd. I&#8217;ve watched you
grow up. That little snowball fight with Martin
twelve years ago this winter was fine. You were
small; but you buried him.&#8221; He laughed like a boy.
Floyd sat down beside him, listening intensely; he
didn&#8217;t want to lose a word. Julie flittered about
the room, watching them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like you, Floyd; you&#8217;re a good fighter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; laughed Floyd, &#8220;I&#8217;m a pacifist.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, you haven&#8217;t found yourself yet. We Jews
are fighters, although the world says we are not.
We&#8217;ve been fighting for thousands of years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he spoke of the possibilities of America
joining the War.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will come; we will be forced into it. We Jews
will get the worst of it as usual, but that&#8217;s good for
us; the will to live becomes stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p>He continually repeated &#8220;we Jews&#8221; as if to impress
the fact of his race upon Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;The American aliens will find relatives in every
European field of battle; it will be terrible, like the
Civil War, brother against brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd had never thought of it that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Jews are like an old tree&mdash;its branches
spread all over the world; it roots are in the Bible.
The Arian education is Greek, opposite to that of
the Hebrew. The Greeks worshipped form, beauty;
its idols were in stone. The Hebrews rejected that;
they based their religion on the &#8216;Word.&#8217; You see?
the body, the Soul; the Image Greek, the Soul
Hebrew.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that, Floyd found his way often to the
fourth floor. He heard many things foreign to his
way of thinking, but of deep interest to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Floyd laughingly one evening, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
made myself popular with all the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Julie, &#8220;there is one more, Father
Cabello.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>Father Cabello was an indispensable part of the
Gonzola family, from the Celtic help in the kitchen,
to the aristocratic old man on the top floor, whose
guest he was on Friday evenings, when he shared a
simple meal of vegetables and fruit, washed down
with a glass of delicious Palestinian wine; after that,
a game of chess, and a long theological discussion
which lasted many a time until the small hours. The
two men, of the same origin but of different creeds,
understood each other perfectly. When it came to
a burning question, such as the sincerity of Paul&mdash;whether
his hatred of the High Priests of Judea
had not instigated him to dethrone them, by putting
another in their place, one he had never seen, or
whether it was an inspiration, &#8220;a voice out of the
wilderness&#8221;&mdash;then Joseph Abravanel&#8217;s eyes took on
a fiery gleam. Father Cabello, seeing the danger
signal, would evade the question by a witty remark,
ending with a laugh. Julie gave Floyd a hint. He
invited the good Father to lunch with him at the
club.</p>

<p>He sat in the window watching the priest shaking
hands with one and the other&mdash;a man of Church and
World, known to rich and poor, and generally beloved.
Floyd had a feeling of embarrassment, but
Father Cabello put him at once in smooth waters
by a remark about the &#8220;exclusive policy&#8221; of the
club.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Floyd. &#8220;This distinction against
aliens is very reactionary.&#8221; He forgot he was on
the membership committee before he was engaged;
then he ventured to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am very glad you do not oppose my marriage
with Julie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew Floyd was not a Catholic; why did he
make him emphasize that?</p>

<p>&#8220;I was prepared for your opposition on account
of my religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who fights the inevitable destroys no
one but himself. I have had one great battle in that
family; I don&#8217;t want a second&mdash;if&mdash;it can be
avoided. When Julie was born, her mother and I
together fought and conquered Joseph Abravanel;
a fine fellow, deeply learned. In the great days of
the Church in Spain, he would have been a distinguished
Cardinal.&#8221; The priest puffed regretfully at
his cigar. &#8220;His ancestors were foolishly fanatic;
they chose the evil of emigration to the glory of
power and the Pope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd answered eagerly.</p>

<p>It was a question of principle; they should be admired,
respected, for such noble self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>The priest liked the boy; there was no complication
to fight in him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This marriage was a question of you and one
other. I chose you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>Floyd&#8217;s face grew hot. It had all been arranged
between the mother and the priest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you considered me the lesser of two evils?&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest smiled again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not an evil, you are a concession; we
make them, if they do not bring us future harm; the
children will be ours, but don&#8217;t let it worry you
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pedro Gonzola&#8217;s marriage with a Jewess was
also a concession. Why did you allow <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This boy is no fool,&#8221; thought the priest; he took
pains to answer the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were mistaken in our calculations, we <i>are</i>
sometimes; we remained passive because we were
sure Joseph Abravanel would fight it with all his
might; and he did. But another power mightier
than he and the Church together won out; the
strongest combination in the world&mdash;youth and love.
Ruth was his only child, she threatened to leave him,
he worshipped her, he had to give in, but he went
to live with the young couple, with a firm resolve to
counteract our influence. The inevitable happened;
she came to us for consolation. Julie was born in
the church.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent. The priest lived again that interesting
conflict. The old man had fought well, he
was wonderful with his unanswerable arguments, but
reason went down under the great emotional rising
of the soul&mdash;the need of forgiveness.</p>

<p>Floyd&#8217;s voice brought him back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>&#8220;Why did he remain in his daughter&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because with the obstinate patience of his race,
he had hopes of Julie&#8217;s children.&#8221; Then he bent
nearer, lowering his voice. &#8220;There is something
else you should know. From the day Julie was baptized,
Joseph Abravanel has never seen or spoken
to his daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The atmosphere of tragedy folded itself about
Floyd; he felt the clashing of spiritual powers, within
the walls of that outwardly peaceful home, now
creeping like slow fire into his life.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>Near Floyd&#8217;s house, there was a small stone
chapel ornamented with dark wooden beams; it had
been built by Mr. Garrison and Mr. Steele. They
brought over their pastor from Scotland, a rugged,
sincere man.</p>

<p>Floyd still grew chilly, when he thought of the
bare whitewashed walls, the stone floor, the hard
wooden benches. No choir, no organ, no stained
glass windows. The pastor generally took his text
from one of those Hebrew &#8220;calamity howlers,&#8221; and
hurled curses at the heads of his unfortunate
parishioners. He was a man of mild disposition, but
he thought it was his duty to snatch them from the
worship of Mammon. The &#8220;Idolaters&#8221; would listen
meekly, rise, sing a hymn, and file out penitently, to
pursue on week days, their ungodly practices.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>In course of time the pastor went to heaven, his
congregation the other way; Martin said it might
be the reverse. Other pastors modified their curses
or ceased to hurl them; the times demanded blessings,
and paid for them. The congregation grew
rich and moved uptown. Floyd kept his pew out of
respect for his parents.</p>

<p>He told the pastor, a sensible man from the West
with a large growing family, of his coming marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not losing you; we lost you when your
father died. Of course, you must consider the
bride&#8217;s family; the women generally arrange those
matters, but I would like to come and see you sometimes.
Your children may in course of time think
differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>He, also, had hopes of the next generation.</p>

<p>Now Floyd pushed away all unpleasant thoughts;
his youth demanded happiness. He went up the
steps of the Gonzola mansion with a light heart,
humming to himself. The butler ushered him into
the dimly lighted parlor. He waited, but Julie did
not come. He heard voices above. He was one of
the family now by right of knowing all its secrets.
He found Julie crouched at the bottom of the upper
stairs; at the door of the old man&#8217;s room was Mrs.
Gonzola on her knees. Floyd tried to question Julie,
but she silenced him with an imperative gesture.</p>

<p>The voices of Father Cabello and Joseph Abravanel,
penetrating the closed door, rang throughout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the house. Floyd heard his name; it was a question
of his marriage with Julie, of the ceremony, and
again, those future generations. He heard the deep
tones of the priest&mdash;threatening, persuasive; the
other voice trembling, feeble, rising in a despairing
shriek, dying away in sobs. It was terrible; every
word seemed to strike that prostrate figure at the
door like a whip. Floyd thought of the rack. The
priest came out wiping his forehead, he lifted the
stricken woman; the Church had won again.</p>

<p>They were married quietly at home, the bride in
old lace and priceless family jewels, a vision of Oriental
beauty. Martin&#8217;s words came back to Floyd.
&#8220;To me she is not a modern girl, she is the Shulamite
maiden who rises from her couch at night and
goes out to seek her lover.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd wanted to bring his wife to the house
where he was born; Julie gladly consented. He had
been so dear, giving in to everybody, for the sake of
peace. At the door of his home, Floyd took Julie
up in his arms and carried her over the threshold as
his fathers had done before him.</p>


<h3>13</h3>

<p>The young couple were called home from a brief
trip, by the sudden death of Joseph Abravanel.</p>

<p>Julie&#8217;s grief was terrible. She stood by the plain
deal coffin where he lay in his shroud, looking long
at the marble face. Floyd felt her suffering, but he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
was powerless to console her. He wondered why
Mrs. Gonzola kept her room; she surely would want
to say good-bye to her father. He turned; she was
there; she entered slowly, as if in fear. Julie made
a quick step forward.</p>

<p>The voice that came from Mrs. Gonzola&#8217;s white
lips was red with the blood of her race.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dare not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have pity on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promised him to keep you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will know, he must rest in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were not mother and daughter; they were
enemies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gonzola turned and went downstairs in
silence. She died a few days later without breaking
that silence.</p>

<p>Joseph Abravanel had given away what little
he possessed during his lifetime; to Julie he left a
small Hebrew prayer book, worn with age. Mrs.
Gonzola&#8217;s will was complicated. She had given generously
to the Church for years. Julie was to have
the house and contents and the income of what was
left, the capital going to the grandchildren on condition
of their fidelity to the Church; otherwise it
went to support a theological seminary in Rome.</p>

<p>They were standing together in the parlor. The
room was icy; her face, pinched, worn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>&#8220;I am going to sell the house and everything in
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Sell your family portraits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of them, persecuting me with
their angry faces. They despise me; I feel it. I
have felt it all my life; as a child I saw them in my
dreams coming out of their frames threatening me!
I am done with them, done with them!&#8221; She broke
into convulsive sobs. She took him by the hand,
and led him around the room, stopping before each
one of her childhood&#8217;s inquisitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to live with them all your life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I certainly do not&mdash;but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have them packed up and sent back to the
family in Europe who will hang them in their picture
galleries. We have none....&#8221;</p>

<p>The sight of Julie in lustreless black and a long
cr&ecirc;pe veil made Floyd shudder; it was awful. Black
obscured her beauty, she spoke in low tones, went
around on tip-toe. There was the silence of death
in his house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stand this, Julie. We&#8217;re living as in a
cemetery; it&#8217;s getting on my nerves. How long is it
going to last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd didn&#8217;t like to appear heartless, but he had
already learnt to use a little diplomacy with his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you realize how unbecoming black is to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, startled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>&#8220;It is my duty to wear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone out of fashion. Only old people wear
cr&ecirc;pe nowadays; a black band is quite sufficient.
Why should you parade your grief?&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t answer, but the next morning she came
to breakfast in a &#8220;royal&#8221; purple tea gown.</p>

<p>Floyd kissed her eyes, lips, hands; he had his
sweetheart again.</p>

<p>Julie smiled at him. She liked to be worshipped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come! I&#8217;m hungry. Don&#8217;t you want any
breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want nothing but you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Japanese laid the morning paper on the table
and discreetly withdrew. Floyd looking over the
headings, sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;War?&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie gave a startled cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t go, you won&#8217;t leave me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must do my duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went down to see Colonel Garland. The office
was in a whirl of excitement. The Colonel was
prancing like an old war horse. Everybody was
talking at once. It had to come; the President had
put it off too long; some were for, some against it,
but the fact was there&mdash;the United States had
thrown her hat into the ring. Floyd&#8217;s face was
flushed, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to volunteer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel looked grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, let the single men go first.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>Floyd couldn&#8217;t be held back; every man he knew
had volunteered. He met Tom Dillon with a little
flag stuck in his buttonhole, his hat set jauntily on
the side of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going into camp tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night there was a scene with Julie; she
begged, cried, fainted. Dr. McClaren was sent for,
the diagnosis was&mdash;Motherhood. Floyd did not
volunteer.</p>

<p>All New York crowded the streets to bid Godspeed
to the first regiment sailing for France. &#8220;Our
Boys&#8221; with flowers in their caps, flowers stuck in
their guns marched proudly. The people went mad.</p>

<p>Floyd, holding Julie tightly, stood on the corner
of Fifth Avenue. He had a feeling of depression;
for the first time in his life a wish had been thwarted.
He looked down at the curly head with its sport-hat
pressed close to his arm, noticed the glances of admiration.
She was worth the sacrifice. Suddenly
with a well-directed aim, she flung a rose at a passing
soldier. He caught it, pressed it to his lips with
a long glance backward.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Martin,&#8221; said Julie.</p>

<p>They walked home in silence. Julie had a headache
from the noise and excitement and went to bed
early.</p>

<p>Floyd sat up; he tried to think of Julie and the
future. He couldn&#8217;t; the cheers were still in his
ears, the tramping of feet, the clashing of cymbals.
He sat there, out of it. Love was cruel....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>The boy was christened by Father Cabello, his
last service to the Gonzola family. He had been
called to Rome, where honors awaited him, for his
services to the Church in America.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name are you going to give him?&#8221; asked
the Father.</p>

<p>Julie, lying in her white bed, answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;His name will be Joseph Abravanel Gonzola
Garrison.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd thought it too high-sounding for modern
times&mdash;an American citizen couldn&#8217;t carry it, but
Julie had her way.</p>

<p>After Father Cabello&#8217;s departure, she went seldom
to the Cathedral and gradually ceased altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lived all my life under the tyranny of two
religions. My boy must be free of that; when he
is old enough he will choose for himself.&#8221; But she
still read her grandfather&#8217;s little Hebrew book at
night when she couldn&#8217;t sleep, or when she awoke
terrified from the reality of her dreams. She never
spoke of it to Floyd, and he didn&#8217;t like to intrude.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">MARTIN STEELE came back to America
after two years&#8217; absence. He was known
over there as the &#8220;Yankee Devil.&#8221; Danger
seemed to attract him; he rushed through a rain of
bullets and planted the flag in the face of the enemy.
He was happy; the straining of nerve and sinew
helped to quiet an inward restlessness. On landing
he found a telegram from his mother; she wanted
him to go up and see &#8220;The Museum&#8221; before coming
to Boston. He tore up the telegram with an ugly
scowl.</p>

<p>The corner of Broadway and Forty-second
Street&mdash;gigantic waves of humanity passing, moving
up, down, across&mdash;screeching automobiles emitting
pestilential odors&mdash;rapidly changing electric signs&mdash;the
only stagnation was in the air&mdash;it weighed on
his chest, halted his breath. He stood with his
hands deep in his pockets. There was something
psychic going on within him; the boys who came
home brought with them a strange consciousness:
they had seen miracles.</p>

<p>He felt the leaden mentality oozing out from the
crowd, became keenly conscious of the mixture of
races; those tense, strained faces, looking straight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
ahead; the past forgotten; the future&mdash;who cares?
&#8220;We build for today; the next man will build for his
day.&#8221; &#8220;The Present&#8221; in electric letters of colored
flames. &#8220;How am I to borrow or steal for&mdash;women&mdash;for
wine. Prohibition?&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;who takes
that seriously; who takes anything seriously?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin elbowed himself through the crowd; a
soldier in khaki, people looked after him; a fine
strong fellow from the prairies, seeing the sight of
the Great White Way.</p>

<p>He mopped his forehead, saying to himself,
&#8220;Where shall I go?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood before the house where he was born,
read the black and gold sign on the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Winthrop Museum. Tuesday, Thursday,
Saturday (admission free); other days fifty cents.&#8221;
It was Friday.</p>

<p>The sleepy official handed him a card. Martin
threw down his fifty cents and entered. There were
a few stragglers strolling from case to case, mostly
strangers. A large omnibus, &#8220;Seeing New York,&#8221;
waited outside; the man on the box blew the horn.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the house of the celebrated Winthrop
family whose ancestors came over in the <i>Mayflower</i>.
The owners have generously donated their historical
relics to the city; ten minutes allowed for inspection.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at the old furniture, falling to pieces
from want of repair; some were really family relics,
but the parading of them&mdash;&#8220;who cares for other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
people&#8217;s old sticks&#8221;? The caretaker was putting on
his hat to go when Martin spoke to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mr. Steele. I&#8217;m going to close up this dugout.&#8221;
He put ten dollars in the man&#8217;s hand. With
one strong wrench he tore down the sign, locked the
door, and put the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>He stopped before the Garrison home; it was lit
up inside. He opened the gate, shut it with a sharp
click, and went up toward Fifth Avenue. The row
of small brick houses were in a sorry plight. On
Maud Ailsworth&#8217;s window there was a sign, &#8220;Table
Board&#8221;; on the Gonzola mansion, &#8220;For Sale.&#8221;
&#8220;The mother and grandfather dead, Julie married.&#8221;
Then he bought the biggest basket of red roses he
could find, and followed on the heels of the messenger.</p>

<p>Floyd was in the nursery, revelling in the beauty
of mother and child&mdash;a wonderful Murillo picture.
Julie laughed at his caressing epithets, &#8220;Two angels
to take care of&#8221;&mdash;etc., etc., and all the rest a man
like Floyd would naturally say to the young mother
of his child. She went to dinner leaning on his arm.
Julie was one of the rare women who become beautiful
with motherhood; from the first moment of its
consciousness, she was a changed being. The grief
and horror of her double misfortune vanished; her
eyes became larger, more brilliant. The dead white
of her skin changed into a soft pink; the rippling
hair shone, getting more and more rebellious, escaping
in soft curls about her face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>She gave a cry of pleasure at the roses on the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how gorgeous! Floyd, you mustn&#8217;t spoil
me like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t send them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my word of honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who? I can&#8217;t think of anyone, unless&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>She fastened a rose in her dress, forgetting to
answer.</p>

<p>The table was faultlessly set with fine damask.
The heavy cut glass sparkled in the candle light. A
pine wood fire threw a soft glimmer over the room;
there was no other light. Floyd felt a sense of
&aelig;sthetic satisfaction. He hated the big flats of the
West Side with their electric illumination; he was
glad he didn&#8217;t have to live in them. The bell rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can that be at this hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t announce me, I&#8217;ll go right in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin!&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie was on her feet looking for a way of escape.
Floyd put her back in her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay where you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd&#8217;s hand went out to meet Martin&#8217;s; he&#8217;d
come back from the front, and they had known each
other all their lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;I landed today. I feel like a stranger in a
foreign land. Will you let me have a bite with
you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>He hadn&#8217;t changed; heavily tanned; a little more
muscular; a little louder. He grasped Julie&#8217;s hand,
and held it fast. There was a slight heaving under
the red rose; her cheeks had lost their color. He
absorbed everything with those eyes of his. She felt
the loose gown hanging from her shoulders, and
drew it around her full bosom. He turned to Floyd,
with a laughing question in his eyes. Floyd laughed
back; he couldn&#8217;t help feeling a sense of triumph.</p>

<p>Martin was very entertaining, told amusing
stories in French; there was something pathetic in
his efforts to please. Julie took a childish delight in
his medals. Floyd&#8217;s face clouded over; Martin took
them from her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;They mean nothing to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should be proud of them,&#8221; insisted Julie.
&#8220;They are a reward for bravery. You were brave.
We read about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give the others the satisfaction of
thinking me a coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you were afraid at first; it&#8217;s only natural.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and looked straight at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. What is there in life for me? It takes
more courage to go on living.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long pause; Julie arose, said &#8220;good night.&#8221;
Floyd went with her to the stairs, kissed
her; Martin&#8217;s eyes followed them. Then Floyd
threw himself into the big chair by the fire, forgetting
everything but the dear woman, the dear
child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>Martin sat puffing at his pipe; it was foul. Julie
couldn&#8217;t bear a pipe. Floyd had given up his
then he shut the door carefully, lit his pipe laughingly,
saying something about a bad example.
He was eager for more stories of war, carnage,
murder.</p>

<p>&#8220;A wonderful experience. I envy you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t leave Julie in her condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence; then Martin spoke in a hard
voice which conveyed repression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your experience has been more wonderful than
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw down his pipe, pacing the room, muttering
broken sentences; there was a strange glitter
in his eyes. He cursed everything, everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patriotism, bah! We punched holes in that lie,
sitting in our dugout waiting for the death call.
Love of the soil; bah! I was born next door; another
year you also will be driven out. Our children
won&#8217;t even know the spot where their parents lived;
what does it matter, anyhow? The farmer, bah!
He values the soil as he does his cow, for what he
can get out of it; it isn&#8217;t <i>his</i> land. He came over,
bought it, because he couldn&#8217;t steal it, mortgaged it,
misused it. The boys won&#8217;t go back to the farm.
They want money, they&#8217;ll get it the next few years.
The rest of the world will starve&mdash;America will wallow
in the filthy stuff&mdash;not you, nor I&mdash;we&#8217;re pikers,
that&#8217;s what we are; our fathers thought they left us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
rich; I could plunge in, reconstruct, sell out, gamble
with my money, and make a fortune. What then?&#8221;
He stood glaring at Floyd, a desperate, hopeless
creature, Martin&#8217;s ravings always depressed him;
Julie&#8217;s voice broke the oppressive silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Floyd, bring Martin up to see the baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway like a bashful boy, Floyd
put the child in his arms; he looked down at the
little dark head against his arm, bent and kissed
it, giving Julie a look of lightning rapidity. It
scorched her.</p>

<p>Martin became a frequent visitor at the Garrisons&#8217;,
running in often at inopportune moments.</p>

<p>Julie was sitting over the fire in the dining-room,
the child asleep in a little pink-lined basket beside
her. She leaned back; there was a feeling of lassitude,
weariness; she had every reason to be happy;
no woman could ask more; but why that longing
to get away from her child, her husband, from herself?
Why did she feel the walls of her life? She
knew there was something wrong with her; she felt
too intensely. Martin! Why had he come back?
She was happy with Floyd; he was good, gentle;
kind, so different; but Martin! Martin!</p>

<p>She heard his voice outside, she must get upstairs;
she went swiftly to the door&mdash;too late&mdash;he
was in the room taking her in with those terrible
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you break in like this? It&#8217;s very inconsiderate.
I am not fit to see strangers.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>&#8220;Strangers, Julie!&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her arms above her head, twisting the
thick ropes of falling hair, trying to fasten them.
Her shawl fell away, disclosing the corsetless form,
the open neck.</p>

<p>Waves of passion rushed through him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go! Give me one moment more, just
one!&#8221; He caught at her shawl. A terrible shame
burnt her. She staggered out, slamming the door
after her. Martin pressed the shawl, warm from
her body, to his face; the hot tears rolled down.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t come again for some time. One day
Floyd met him at the club.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we see you at the house? We miss
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s eyes had a look of abstraction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your home is like a nest just now. There is
room in it only for two&mdash;and the little bird.&#8221; It was
a beautiful thought; but that humor never lasted
long with him. He said abruptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sold my house. They are going to build a
skyscraper. It will take away your light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd&#8217;s face darkened.</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t drive us out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why stay there? You can get a big profit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born there; I want to die there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man who dies in the house where he was born
should be ticketed and put into a museum.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>The wreckers were at work tearing down the
Steele house. Floyd, passing, found Martin in overalls,
his hair, face, eyelashes, white with plaster
dust, his tongue swinging with the hammer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You obstinate devil, I&#8217;ll show you who is the
master.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wall was well built, too well; in the old days
they built for the future. He gave it a blow, another,
another; it didn&#8217;t yield. He worked himself
into a purple rage. Blow after blow fell upon the
unhappy partition; it trembled, the others jumped
away; it fell. Martin stood triumphantly among
the ruins.</p>

<p>Floyd&#8217;s eyes grew moist. Was there no feeling
in the man? Did he realize he had made himself
homeless? Now he must join the rich tramps, the
poor tramps, that army of wanderers living here
awhile, there awhile, places to sleep and eat; luxurious,
tawdry, squalid imitations, according to their
money value. New York was becoming a homeless
city.</p>

<p>He related the incident to Julie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin looks seedy, he neglects his appearance,
he&#8217;s a forsaken wretch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie had a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get him married.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes two for that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>Julie stood before her mirror; a pleasing picture
flashed back. A smooth young face&mdash;not a trace of
the physical agony she had been through, of the
mental agony; her life was running now along
smooth, conventional lines&mdash;a beautiful woman,
bending forward, studying her expression. Is there
a tell-tale line? No; the mask fits to the life.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Maud Ailsworth invited to dinner to meet
Martin. Julie was going to see what she could do.
Maud&#8217;s mother had been dead four years; she had
known her only as an invalid propped up by pillows,
with an ice bag on her head. Maud left school early
to take the housekeeping, which was a sorry job, in
her hands. Mrs. Ailsworth&#8217;s philosophy of living
was that good things were cheapest in the end. The
modest capital left by her husband melted, they sold
the house, and lived on the money. When Mrs.
Ailsworth died, Maud had five thousand dollars.
She took a room on the top floor rear of a fashionable
hotel, and spent her time looking for a husband.
She wanted a nice man, she would wait another year;
and then&mdash;there was always Tom Dillon. She
didn&#8217;t have to act with him. He knew she was a
beggar, she knew he was a rotter; but she wouldn&#8217;t
do it until her last penny was gone. She still had
hopes of someone better. She was pretty, quick
with an answer, and much liked by men, but&mdash;they
didn&#8217;t marry her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>She asked herself that question many a night,
after a party, where the men went the limit. There
<i>she</i> stopped; the other girls jumped the boundaries.
She wondered if that was why she was single at
twenty-five. Well, she couldn&#8217;t; it wasn&#8217;t her virtue,
it was her misfortune.</p>

<p>She noticed at a first glance how much prettier
Julie had become, but she didn&#8217;t compliment her. It
wasn&#8217;t her way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have had a hard time, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it&#8217;s worth all I suffered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud&#8217;s nostrils expanded, taking in the subtle
essence of violet powder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I <i>smell</i> the baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flew to the crib and took the child in her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You handle it like a grandmother!&#8221; cried Julie.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get married?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud laughed mirthlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Because the only man I really want won&#8217;t
ask me; it&#8217;s your fault, Julie&mdash;one wasn&#8217;t enough
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with the other?&#8221; insisted
Maud.</p>

<p>Julie answered with a touch of seriousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to get him for you, if I can. Do you
like him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud spoke slowly, weighing her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Liking is too neutral for Martin Steele; it is
either love or hate; I think I hate him.&#8221; She gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
a quick glance into the mirror as they went down to
dinner.</p>

<p>The men were waiting in the parlor. Martin was
ill at ease; he felt like a waiter in evening dress.
Floyd wore it differently; he melted into it. Maud
as the guest of honor was charming. All laughed
heartily at her frank admissions, and keen enjoyment
of the fruits so long forbidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a free hand. Politically, economically;
the right to work&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have it,&#8221; interrupted Martin. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give you my share.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we want more&mdash;Moral Equality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a step backward?&#8221; said Floyd. &#8220;Until
now, women were supposed to be morally superior
to men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should they be? Equal rights is all we
want. We are no longer going to be &#8216;cast out&#8217; for
acting naturally.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin took up the gauntlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you want to have children without
being married?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud&#8217;s eyes shot defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you taken that privilege?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Not yet, but I don&#8217;t know what I may do.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was getting too personal, Julie arose from the
table. Floyd lingered with Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t mean a word of all that. She&#8217;s a fine
woman; she&#8217;ll make a good wife and mother.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>Martin blew rings of smoke into the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure she will, but I&#8217;m not interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud was curled up in an armchair by the fire,
one leg under her, the other hanging down; she was
smoking a cigarette in a gold-mounted amber
holder.</p>

<p>Julie put her arm in Floyd&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go and say good night to baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin smiled at her transparent subterfuge. He
looked down at Maud; a well-shaped head, correct
features, eyes curious; the black stuff she used gave
them the requisite look of the demi-mondaine. The
glass beads around her neck were cheap; what there
was of the gown was evidently designed and put together
by herself. Her thin silk stockings were
going in the seams; he was sure there were holes in
the feet. He&#8217;d like to dress her well. Yes, she was
a nice girl; he could easily be single with her for six
months&mdash;but marriage?</p>

<p>Julie&#8217;s laugh rang out upstairs. Maud was conscious
of being checked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the verdict?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me say what I think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you let me do the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will say more than you believe, I less.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something fascinating in the fellow&#8217;s
insolence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Legs, neck, shoulders, bust, perfect; the symmetry
of thighs and limbs&mdash;classic; but you leave
me cold.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>&#8220;Why?&#8221; She bent over with a touch of eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because there is nothing of mystery about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha; why should a woman be a mystery?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then came a flash which revealed depths unsounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because all holy things are mysterious; when a
woman ceases to be holy to man, she kills love in
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud wouldn&#8217;t argue on those lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other men don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do. Have you ever been inside the
Museum of Art in Central Park?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;ve been to the receptions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come with me to see the pictures and
statues?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go anywhere with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat on the arm of her chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find in some of the mutilated Grecian
goddesses the same length of limbs and lines of
body; but they are modestly undraped&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop. I don&#8217;t like that expression; I believe in
leaving something to the imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s imagination in that respect is a vile
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought of it that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of it that way, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It slipped out; she was sorry at once, but she
didn&#8217;t recall it.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I look at the girl of today, I feel that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
am passing with the rest of the crowd before those
wonderful marble statues, which belong to everyone,
to <i>no one</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was on her feet now blazing at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you demand purity in us? Set the
example; we&#8217;ll follow suit. We give what we receive;
no more, no less.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a rush for the door. He caught her
two arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You women! You women! You prate equality;
you&#8217;d hate like the devil to have it. You know
you&#8217;ve got the best of us.&#8221; Martin&#8217;s voice rang
out; it was always too loud when he was excited.
&#8220;The woman of today is gambling with every chance
against her; if she wins, she loses; she&#8217;ll get everything
she wants, even sexual equality; and when she
has it, she&#8217;ll lose the glory of Life for the human
race. Look at me. I&#8217;m the average man, no better,
no worse; and the most miserable, lonely wretch
that ever walked in a city overcrowded with beautiful
women. I would marry any one of them&mdash;high,
low, rich, poor, if she would give me the love I&#8217;m
craving for. Tell me the truth now: can you love
anybody but yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to extricate herself from his iron grasp,
his accusing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t! You hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He released her with a bitter laugh.</p>

<p>When Julie came in, Maud was hysterical. Martin
must have been saying something awful.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>The Japanese announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ailsworth&#8217;s car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Have you a car?&#8221; exclaimed Julie.</p>

<p>&#8220;It belongs to Tom Dillon; he wants me to keep
his chauffeur busy.&#8221; She was herself again, saucy,
reckless, unthinking.</p>

<p>Martin bent over her, speaking in low tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go home with you; we&#8217;ll make up on the
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew what he meant&mdash;she&#8217;d show him&mdash;he
couldn&#8217;t love <i>her</i> for the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you; a man&#8217;s escort is not a guarantee
of safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed Julie and swept out, followed by Floyd.
He stood at the door of the car; there was something
wrong with Maud. He thought he saw tears
in her eyes. He jumped into the car and went
home with her. Julie was at the window as they
drove off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Floyd&#8217;s gone with her. He&#8217;s so old-fashioned;
he hates to see women roaming about alone
at night; he won&#8217;t be long.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pulled down the blinds, put out the lights,
leaving only the candles and the glow of the fire.</p>

<p>Martin stood watching her. She began to feel
uncomfortable. Why didn&#8217;t he say something? She
was afraid of his silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maud&#8217;s a nice girl, and very popular. I wonder
why she doesn&#8217;t marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered roughly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to marry her; drop that idea, will
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came close to her, leaning against the side-board.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re disappointed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Oh, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confess.&#8221; He put his hand under her chin, and
forced her to look at him. &#8220;You want to get rid of
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the half light, her face was like ivory. Her
eyes shone back into his. He started, and put his
hand on her shoulder; what was it he saw there?
She came closer to him, closer; he dared not move.
She kissed him again, again, murmuring soft love
words. Then he broke out, held her as if he would
never let her go, calling her his beautiful Queen, his
Oriental Pearl, his Song of Songs. She clung to
him, her body responding to his; how long?&mdash;a
moment, which goes back centuries, a century which
is only a moment. He felt her tears on his face, as
she caressed and kissed him; every drop of blood in
him answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted you always. You know it&mdash;you know
it. I thought the longing would wear away with
time; my mother said it would. I believed her; but
she lied to me, lied! It was always there, getting
more and more unbearable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin closed her lips with a long kiss. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
wonderful tempting, seductive creature; he would
never let her go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted you to marry Maud to save myself.
When I saw you with her tonight, the pain was unbearable.
I couldn&#8217;t go on&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221; Then she
drew away from him, and went over to the fire, her
hands clasped together, her face convulsed; the red
light enveloped her.</p>

<p>He came to her. She put out her hand to keep
him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over?&#8221; How little she knew him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is only the beginning. You were mine; I
never forgot, never. They stole you from me;
nothing can part us now. Nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was in his arms again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It had to come, or I should have lost my reason;
it&#8217;s over now. Go, before he comes back.&#8221;</p>

<p>She slipped away from him. He went out. She
groped toward the door; where was it? She was
blind; then she fell.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Martin entered his hotel; it was past twelve. The
night orgy had commenced. He passed through the
room thronged with dancers, his coat buttoned up to
his neck, his soft hat drawn over his eyes; stood a
moment looking on, a strange silent figure out of
place in that decorative humanity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>He sat by the open window in his room; the noise
from below was deadened by space into a soft humming
sound. Waves of icy air enveloped him.
He was unconscious of cold or heat. In the flash of
a moment, life had taken on a different aspect; his
entire being was one great pulsation. Floyd&mdash;the
difficulties before him, the dishonor of it, came
faintly from a distant perspective, but he thrust it
fiercely behind him. The woman filled the world
for him; he lived over and over that moment of
tearing joy, her face transfigured with passion, her
lips, her tears, the pressure of her body against his&mdash;a
statue come to life, for him alone. He had been
tricked out of his happiness by her mother&mdash;but now
all the powers of Hell couldn&#8217;t keep him away from
her.</p>

<p>A restless night fixed his resolve. He knew exactly
what he was going to do. He dressed more
slowly than usual, moving about in a kind of hushed
manner; he was no longer alone; she was there,
clinging to him. He jumped into a taxi and drove
down to Twelfth Street. The shades were lowered
in the Garrison house. Next door the wreckers had
been clearing away the debris; there was now a
large open space where his home had been. The
Italian foreman came up to him, speaking in his
pleasant broken English.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good job, eh? Everything gone, clean as a
whistle. Tomorrow we commence to build.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin opened the gate of the Garrison house; as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
he stood at the door, his hand on the knocker, he
had a feeling of being mentally unstrung. Criminologists
say when thieves go to commit a crime they
are sustained by a strong sense of fatality, a fixed
idea that it must be; they are drawn into the vortex
of crime by an irresistible fascination&mdash;the lure of
adventure, the justification of the equality of human
rights, the spoils, the gambler&#8217;s risk. Martin felt
vaguely all this; a sense of excitement stimulated
him, like strong liquor. He caught his breath as he
entered the room he had left the night before. She
was coming to him again; now he would be the first
to take her in his arms, to hold her until she would
consent to go with him; he would have to coax, perhaps
to threaten. He set his teeth; he had decided;
it must be or he would kill himself and her.</p>

<p>The door opened; he turned with a smile. Floyd
stood there, very pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie is not well. When I came back last night,
I found her lying unconscious on the ground. Did
she complain to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor says it&#8217;s a serious nervous collapse.
They have shut me out of the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I do anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep me posted, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had counted with everything but that&mdash;</p>

<p>He waited, eating himself up with suppressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
fury; grew thin, unbearable in his impatience; he
would have her; nothing could prevent it but&mdash;death!</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>The telephone rang in Dr. McClaren&#8217;s office.
The doctor was breakfasting, but he didn&#8217;t enjoy as
usual his porridge with cream and heavy black bread
made by his Scotch housekeeper; his mind was elsewhere.
He had been up a greater part of the night
with young Mrs. Garrison, who went off from one
fainting spell into another; she complained of intense
pains in her head. He left her sleeping under
bromides; she worried him. Dr. McClaren had
lived forty years in New York; a gigantic man, with
bushy, iron-gray hair and eyebrows, a noble head,
keen, kind eyes.</p>

<p>His friends had advised him to &#8220;take out his
papers&#8221;; he did, and paid his taxes honestly, but
never voted. He couldn&#8217;t understand the political
rings; he let them fight it out without help from him.
Born in Edinburgh, he studied medicine at its excellent
severe university, went to London to practice,
starved there five years, then turned his back on an
&#8220;ungrateful country&#8221; that refused an able doctor a
living.</p>

<p>Coming over to America, he made friends with
some &#8220;natives,&#8221; and liked them&mdash;nice simple fellows,
&#8220;they open their hearts to you, like a grab bag
at a fair; everything in it is yours.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>&#8220;Medicine is a paying profession among Americans;
they go about with boxes of pills in every
pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor, my wife&#8217;s just been through an operation.
She&#8217;s nervous, give her something to quiet
her, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor objected to sedatives when not absolutely
necessary, but he found the frail American
woman had her own chest of quieting drugs. She
talked of her operation in professional terms, like
a doctor. He wondered if she knew she could have
no children. He wouldn&#8217;t tell her; it would break
her heart, poor thing. He soon found out she <i>did</i>
know, and didn&#8217;t break her heart about it.</p>

<p>With the help of his new friends, who went to
unbelievable trouble and sacrifice of valuable time
to show him &#8220;the ropes,&#8221; he was established in the
spacious home in Thirty-fourth Street, which he
eventually bought; it was the only permanent thing
in his life. His simple Americans became complicated
millionaires. The sands of humanity
shifted from decade to decade. A great city in the
making left him many a time bare of patients, but
the winds of immigration blew them in again. The
tidal wave of Europe&#8217;s overflow became a national
industry&mdash;a weird wonderful gigantic machine; they
put in a crazy combination of human beings, and it
vomited&mdash;Americans.</p>

<p>The assistant put his head in the door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>&#8220;Mr. Garrison seems agitated. He would like
you to come at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor threw down his napkin and jumped
into his car; the Garrisons were one of the few old
families left. He was very fond of young Garrison;
he had brought him into the world; nothing like
that baby had even been seen before; there was a
controversy about the name; Mr. Garrison wanted
James, according to tradition when it had ceased to
be Jan, but she wouldn&#8217;t hear of anything so vulgar;
she named the child Floyd, after the hero of Mrs.
Holmes&#8217; last novel.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;suppose he should develop
into a strong individuality; that name would
be too weak for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Prudence. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be like all
the men of the family, a perfect gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Floyd&#8217;s father had lived, he would never have
consented to the marriage. Julie was a hysterical
girl, with a tendency to epilepsy; that was a secret
in a family of many secrets; she grew out of it, but
there were always over developed emotional symptoms.
He was called in one night. She had been
taken ill at the opera; the music affected her; she
was quite stiff; he brought her to with difficulty. He
had a shock when he heard of Floyd&#8217;s marriage.
He thought there was something going on between
Julie and Martin Steele. The young couple seemed
to be very happy; she was a passionate mother; such
mothers don&#8217;t make good wives.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>He stood looking down thoughtfully at the sick
woman, tossing from one side of the bed to the
other. He had assured Floyd it was only a nervous
attack. The excavating going on in the neighborhood
accounted for the chills alternating with fever.
She was delirious for hours, and after, exhausted,
lifeless. Floyd wanted to consult another doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, not necessary yet; it would frighten the
patient, but I&#8217;ll send for Miss Mary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was bewildered; Julie was in perfect health
and high spirits when he left and drove with Maud
to her hotel. Scarcely an hour had intervened; he
found her unconscious. What did it mean?</p>

<p>Julie was not talkative about herself, although
she drew every thought out of him. Was there anything
worrying her? Could any woman have it
better? He was her constant companion, anticipated
her every wish; what more could he do?</p>

<p>He sat brooding, the breakfast before him
untouched, his paper unopened. Someone was
fumbling at the knocker outside; he went to the
door; he had a vague impression of a very small
person; a clear voice spoke; it was like a bell ringing
in his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Garrison&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, what can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I&#8217;m going to try to do something for
you.&#8221; She flew up the stairs.</p>

<p>He was a bit startled, as if a bird had suddenly
fluttered past him. He followed her, she had already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
thrown off her cape, under which was a white
linen dress. She took an apron and cap from her
bag, quickly put them on without a mirror; they sat
at just the proper angles; she was used to dressing
in the dark. Julie was lying across the bed; the
covering was in knots, the pillows all cavities. The
girl bent over her, murmuring low sounds like a
dove cooing. Floyd tried to distinguish the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very uncomfortable. Yes, I know how
your head aches. Oh, what pretty hair! It&#8217;s heavy,
isn&#8217;t it? Let me roll it up for you. How warm
you are. No wonder.&#8221; She flew to the windows,
let them down top and bottom, putting a screen at
the bed to shield the patient from the draught.</p>

<p>She spoke in a low but extraordinarily clear voice,
every syllable sharply cut.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bowl of cracked ice, please; now the linen.
Don&#8217;t bother; I&#8217;ll find everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was already in the next room exploring.
When Floyd came up with ice, she was changing the
sheets; it was the most remarkable feat he had ever
seen, she rolled one off and slipped on the other
without disturbing the patient. Her hands were
tiny, but flexible, strong; it was magic. How the
room changed; everything in order, the bed fresh
and clean, the patient soothed. She held Julie&#8217;s
hand, whispering all kinds of encouraging things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going to give you something to eat;
you&#8217;re hungry, of course you are; that husband of
yours starves you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>She threw a smiling look at Floyd, who smiled
back at her. She knew he spoilt his wife; he could
see that.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t go away; I&#8217;ll stay right here.&#8221; She
took a bottle of prepared food out of her bag, which
she warmed on the electric heater, cooing all the
time, going about noiselessly on the smallest feet
Floyd had ever seen. A trained nurse from his
experience was a loud, fat, middle-aged woman who
upset the house, ate all day long, and had to be
waited on by the family. This little fairy was so
helpful, so executive; she knew it all, she hadn&#8217;t
asked a question.</p>

<p>When Dr. McClaren came that day, he gave a
quick glance around and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now everything will be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd followed him down stairs. After a short
silence the doctor spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has your wife any worries?&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to be quite truthful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; at least, none that I know of.&#8221; Then
he spoke about that &#8220;little girl&#8221; upstairs, remarking
how wonderfully quick she was.</p>

<p>The doctor smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she very young?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s had twenty-three years of hard experience.
She was born in a hospital. Her mother died at her
birth. The lot of us took care of her&mdash;the scrub
woman, the nurses, the doctors, the patients; she
grew up inhaling iodoform; it&#8217;s healthier than eau<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
de cologne. Her dolls were little orphan babies.
She learnt to sterilize instruments at an age when
most children are being &#8216;perambulated&#8217; in the park.
She toddled after me, sat on the cots, watched the
patients get well, watched them die. I could have
made a good doctor out of her, but she thought
nursing was more helpful. Her school graduates
human beings.&#8221;</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>The patient improved. Miss Mary watched her
drop into a quiet sleep, then flew over to see the
doctor. She perched on the arm of a big chair; it
wouldn&#8217;t do to sit in it when one is tired; it was
too comfortable&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here? Anything wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s that poor man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor chuckled. Floyd Garrison, spoilt
child of Fortune, husband of the prettiest woman
of New York&#8217;s pretty women, belonging to an exclusive
set, the happy father of a fine boy, and here
comes this child of the gutter and calls him &#8216;a poor
man.&#8217; Ha! Ha!</p>

<p>&#8220;The house is going to ruin, the food spoilt; the
butler steals his neckties, stockings, handkerchiefs;
the cook falsifies the bills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how can we cure that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By reforming the household; would it appear
obtrusive?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but he&#8217;s a nice fellow and you
might try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, that&#8217;s what I came for. I want to make
you my partner in crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wretch.&#8221; He flung a writing pad at her, which
she dodged with great dexterity, and flew out.</p>

<p>That night the dinner was uneatable. Floyd
looked helpless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Things are going badly, since my wife&#8217;s illness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was Mary&#8217;s chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me attend to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd thanked her, hoped she wouldn&#8217;t bother too
much, put his car at her disposal, then followed her
softly up the stairs, feeling that he had managed the
house very well. Julie was asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I could go to the club for a couple
of hours&mdash;that is, if I&#8217;m not wanted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, go; it will do you good. Take the latch
key and come in as quietly as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning Floyd enjoyed a good breakfast,
waited on by a very pretty girl in black, with
a dainty cap and apron. He had never liked a
waitress&mdash;too much like a tearoom, but Ellen, the
new maid, didn&#8217;t give him a chance to miss the
butler; she hovered around watching Miss
Mary, responding to her quick glances. This
amused Floyd. Martin must come to dinner; he&#8217;d
fire off witticisms about being under petticoat
government.</p>

<p>Ellen was a girl-mother; her sweetheart promised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
to marry her, but he didn&#8217;t. Miss Mary saw her
through her trouble, took her baby to Bridget, the
wife of a coal heaver, who had seven babies. Mary
encouraged Bridget to go on having them, but the
cost of living was too high even for a coal heaver.
She took the poor &#8220;bastard&#8221; to her wonderful
bosom, and nursed it, happy because she didn&#8217;t have
to dry up her milk. Mary put Bridget in the
kitchen, Ellen in the dining-room; the little brat was
smuggled in, and was so quiet, Mary was sure he
knew he wasn&#8217;t wanted. She put a neighbor who
was also &#8220;under obligations&#8221; in charge of the seven
babies.</p>

<p>Floyd was allowed to go in every morning and
sit with his wife; he noticed Mary remained in the
room. He said the same thing, mechanically, every
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You feel better this morning, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; The
atmosphere of the sick room struck him dumb; that
ghostly silent creature lying there wasn&#8217;t Julie.</p>

<p>He sat at the breakfast table&mdash;well cooked, well
served. There was a flutter on the stairs. Mary
flew in and sat opposite him, giving him a quick
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mary, we should have a night nurse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, there is no necessity of another nuisance
in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, you get no sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear you moving about at night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>&#8220;Oh, do you? I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;ll get a pair of soft
slippers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went up as usual to see Julie. Mary met him
at the door.</p>

<p>She said in a low tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a minute and don&#8217;t stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You feel better this morning, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes were very wide open; she was looking
beyond him; he turned; there was nobody in the
room. Miss Mary was at the telephone calling the
doctor.</p>

<p>The sick woman raised herself in the bed, holding
out her arms like a child who wants to be taken up.
He bent to lift her; she pushed him away with unbelievable
force.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you. I want&mdash;Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Mary came flying into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s delirious again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cry never ceased; over and over again, supplicating,
in a pitiable voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want Martin!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the doctor came, she caught at him eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want, dear lady; tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want Martin!&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd&#8217;s anguish was terrible; he was leaning
against the door on the verge of a collapse. Mary
signaled the doctor, who took him by the arm and
led him into the next room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it Martin Steele?&#8221; said the doctor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. She doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s saying.&#8221;
Floyd&#8217;s voice was harsh. He was on his feet in a
frenzy of rage.</p>

<p>The voice came again, louder, more despairing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want Martin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do something, for God&#8217;s sake!&#8221; cried Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to be done but wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor went back into the room. The cry
continued. Miss Mary came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, is she worse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but the doctor says, &#8216;telephone.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd took up the receiver. What could Martin
do in that room? &#8220;No! no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin! Martin!&#8221; It came again, that cry; it
was terrible.</p>

<p>Mary put the receiver in his hand. He called up
the hotel.</p>

<p>The answer came, &#8220;Out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried the club.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Steele was there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Floyd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie?&#8221; came like a shot through the &#8217;phone.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is about the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd heard the quick gasp of relief; wonderful
how a wire can bear witness.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has intermittent attacks of fever, calls for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
her grandfather, her mother; she called your name
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means nothing, of course, but the doctor
thinks if she sees someone outside the family&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In a short time, Martin was there. Floyd went
down to meet him; neither spoke. Floyd led the
way upstairs. They stopped at the door of the sick
room, and heard the cry of the delirious woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin! I want Martin!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a bound Martin flung himself on his knees
beside the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie! Julie!&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, heavy with fever; they wandered
about, seeking! seeking!</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie!&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted herself into his arms.</p>

<p>He held her close, whispering caressing words;
she listened, her eyes fixed by the power of his; soon
the tired lids drooped; she slept.</p>

<p>Martin felt the fluttering of her heart. He had
no sense of time, place; the world was unpeopled;
he was the only man, she the only woman. The
doctor&#8217;s watch registered forty minutes. Mary
looked at Floyd. His eyes never left them; his
wife in his friend&#8217;s arms. The doctor laid the sleeping
woman gently back on the pillow. Martin
dropped his head down on the bed, helpless; Miss
Mary led him downstairs; he fell in a heap in the
chair. He was conscious now of Floyd, not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
friend&mdash;a stranger, with a drawn face, an icy voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there between you and my wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>The ticking of a clock became distinctly sharp.
Should he tell the truth now? No; it would make it
impossible for him to come again; he would wait
until she got well. He put his hands on Floyd&#8217;s
shoulders, looking him straight in the face.</p>

<p>Floyd repeated his question.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there between you and my wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What there has always been, a deep affection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trying to steal her from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you think that; you told me yourself
she called the names of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lied. She called no one but you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s face was telling tales; he went over to
the fireplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are unjust to her, but, if you persist, I won&#8217;t
come again.&#8221; His voice faltered; his eyes filled up.
Floyd had never been able to resist him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two are my only friends; if I lose you there
is nobody, nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the door, then turned and put out his
hand. They were friends again&mdash;to all appearances.</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>Mary jumped into the doctor&#8217;s car, and held a
consultation. She sat with her legs drawn up, her
elbows on her knees, her little serious face puckered.
He liked her like that; something was coming.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>&#8220;Well, doctor,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>She put her little head on the side and returned
his glance. She didn&#8217;t smile as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a psychosis. The fever is not physical; it&#8217;s
a condition of the mind. I think she needs analysing.&#8221;</p>

<p>His Scotch wrath broke over her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that!&mdash;I won&#8217;t have it with her; this analysing
has done too much mischief, dragging the
wild beasts out of their caverns, showing the poor
victims the horrors that are within them. I tell you,
the people are playing with psycho-analysis like children
with dynamite; they don&#8217;t understand it, nor
do we, yet. Let that woman alone, do you hear!&mdash;unless
you want to rob her of the little reason she
has left. She&#8217;s the victim of heredity; we can&#8217;t
change that, can we? She&#8217;s the victim of a certain
physical tendency, inborn; we can&#8217;t change that;
she&#8217;s the victim of the errors of her ancestors; we
can&#8217;t change that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Doctor, but we all are, if we knew it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing we don&#8217;t. Now I hope this
woman&#8217;s love for her child and her husband will
counteract other influences; mind you, she&#8217;s a good,
innocent woman; but she is obsessed by an evil spirit
which must be exorcised.&#8221; There he was, the old
Scotch Calvinist.</p>

<p>Julie was quiet until evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Floyd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to see him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary flew downstairs. Floyd was trying to read
the evening paper; trying to be just to his wife, his
friend. He hated to be suspicious; it turned the
honey of life to gall; such thoughts made him ill;
he couldn&#8217;t live with them. He heard a patter, patter.
Mary put her head in the door, beckoning him.
He found Julie crushed into the pillows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mary says I&#8217;ve been out of my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was vexed. Why did Miss Mary tell her
that?</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I say irrational things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, just babbled a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only disconnected words without meaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>She evidently didn&#8217;t know what had happened.</p>

<p>Floyd smoked his pipe that night, and read Emerson
on Friendship. Martin was to be pitied; he was
a lonely wretch; he&#8217;d give him the benefit of the
doubt. Mary came in to say good night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is all right. We&#8217;ll close up early.
She&#8217;ll have a quiet night, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hope was not realized. The sick woman had
a terrible night; her pulse was jumping like a
frenzied thing, but her mind was clear. She clung
frantically to Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m lost! save me! save me!&#8221; then she broke into
convulsive sobbing, always begging to be helped.
Mary shut the door carefully. It wouldn&#8217;t do for
that &#8220;poor man&#8221; to hear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>Floyd tossed uneasily. He was sure there was
something mentally wrong with Julie; he had heard
of women getting &#8220;queer&#8221; after weaning a child.
He had been too harsh with Martin. She had called
him in her delirium; that meant nothing. Martin
had wanted to marry her, but it was all long forgotten;
she was <i>his</i> wife now, the mother of his child;
it was foolish to make a fuss about a few moments
of delirium. Julie would never know about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>He jumped out of bed and listened. He thought
he heard somebody calling, &#8220;Martin! Martin!&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie&#8217;s door was shut; all was still. It was his
own imagination; that cry was still in his ears. He
went back to bed; he must get that idea out of his
head; he wouldn&#8217;t let it become a mania with him.
He would see Martin often, have him to dinner. It
was low of him to keep on thinking evil of them
both. The thought acted like a sedative; he slept.</p>

<p>He was up and dressed before seven. The night&#8217;s
depression descended again over him like a black
veil. There was a knock; Mary stood outside, pale,
agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was dark. He saw Julie&#8217;s figure lying across
the bed; she was in a deep sleep. Mary opened a
shutter gently. He stifled an exclamation. The
long thick wavy hair flowing loosely over the pillow,
over her heart, had turned white; she lay in an ocean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
of foam. What had happened to her in the night?
What had been at work in her brain?&mdash;he had heard
vaguely of a sudden shock turning the hair white.
He gazed and gazed; it was as if an artist had
dipped his brush into molten silver and drawn it
through every hair in her head. Another long look;
then he went downstairs, putting his hand on the
balustrade to support himself.</p>

<p>Mary closed the shutter softly and followed him.
His mind was confused. The ordeal with his wife,
culminating in this, was too much; he needed help.
She waited, standing quietly beside him. He felt
her intense sympathy; then he said in a low, hushed
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;What could have caused it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can easily be accounted for. Your wife is subject
to violent nervous headaches; she had an attack
in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she sobbing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she suffered terribly. We must be brave
for her sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her standing there, her eyes shining,
undaunted, courageous. Where did she get that
spirit? She was no longer only a nurse; she was a
comrade, a fellow-fighter; her voice was like a call
to arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was always very happy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean, I
thought it was happiness, but I see now that it was
like being under shelter when others were destitute;
that kind of happiness is selfish, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I try not to be
too happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My parents were my only friends. They left
me; I had only my wife. Perhaps I wanted too
much from her; she was unfortunate in her family;
I should have taken better care&mdash;I&mdash;can&#8217;t see
ahead! I don&#8217;t know how this will affect her. I&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a blow, but you can soften it for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, what can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary hesitated. Why was she obliged to say
what he should have known intuitively: did he love
his wife?</p>

<p>&#8220;Her heart would be at rest if you would convince
her it doesn&#8217;t matter to you what color her
hair is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was on his feet, his eyes averted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to tell her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the door, then came back. &#8220;Will you
come with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better for you to go alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He entered his wife&#8217;s room, sat down beside the
bed, feeling like an intruder. She awoke startled,
her eyes were deep with the sleep-shadows of
opiates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I frighten you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I felt someone was here&mdash;Something
has happened! Tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Your hair.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>&#8220;What about my hair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has turned gray since last night.&#8221; She was
out of bed with a bound, standing before the mirror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let in the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went from window to window; the sun struck
the surface of the looking glass, dancing in and out
of the silver veil that enveloped her.</p>

<p>She gave a low cry, and shrunk away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie, don&#8217;t grieve about what can&#8217;t be helped;
it often happens from such headaches; it&#8217;s your
nerves.&#8221; He wanted to say, &#8220;You will always be
the same to me because I love you.&#8221; He couldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a symptom, it is a punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done nothing to deserve punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, through him, past him. He
didn&#8217;t know her thoughts; that door was closed to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see Miss Mary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary was surprised to find her patient sitting
up in bed. She had wound her hair in a tight
coil around her head, covering it with a heavy lace
cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mary, I am feeling better this morning; I
don&#8217;t think I shall need you any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary gasped. Where was the exhausted creature
of the night before, the helpless invalid?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad, Mrs. Garrison. Any time you
send for me, I will come.&#8221; Then she took Julie&#8217;s
hand, bent forward and kissed her; there was a
slight quiver of the mouth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ungrateful, but I couldn&#8217;t bear
you to say anything; it&#8217;s unspeakable, good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was waiting in the hall when Mary came
down with her hat on, carrying her suitcase.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing more for me to do here. Your
wife is better; the shock will cure her.&#8221; Then she
smiled at him. &#8220;I&#8217;m aching for the slums; my
cradle stood there; there I learnt what life means;
when I get thinking too much of myself, I go back
and learn again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went with her to the door, and held her hand
in a strong grasp; he could think of nothing worth
saying. A cloud of dust blew in their faces; they
were pulling down the little row of brick houses on
the other side.</p>

<p>Floyd stopped in the hall to brush himself off.
The wreckers were working within him, scattering
debris. He went up to his wife&#8217;s room again,
listened; there was no sound. He turned the knob
cautiously; the door was locked. There was a sense
of relief; he wouldn&#8217;t have to spend the morning in
that dark room. He jumped into a taxi and drove
to his club.</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>Julie gradually recovered; there was a feeling of
strength in her limbs, a desire for movement she
hadn&#8217;t felt since the birth of her child; it was the
strength of despair. One day she took out her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
pretty gowns and hung them one by one on silk
hangers in the room next to her bedroom. It had
been Floyd&#8217;s den; he used to sit there at night during
the first year of their marriage, reading. He
could see his darling in her lace-trimmed bed.
She complained she had no place to hang the Paris
creations he bought for her; he suggested putting
racks around his den, which they did; those lace,
gold and silver gowns seemed to him to hang on
bodies which swayed to and fro in the draught. The
face was always Julie&#8217;s, in her different moods. The
perfume stifled him. He had an old-fashioned idea
about perfume; his mother never used it. He gave
up reading there at night.</p>

<p>She put her hats in boxes, her slippers, stockings,
lingerie, wrapped carefully in tissue paper, in an old
bureau, a family relic which Floyd refused to sell; it
was two hours of fatiguing work, but she wasn&#8217;t
tired. She opened the door and peered out; there
was no one about; she crept down the stairs, went
from room to room, covered furniture and mirrors
with gray linen, and crept up again. When Ellen
came home with the boy, she noticed her dark shining
hair. She dismissed her on the spot, and rang
up for the Japanese butler to come back.</p>

<p>Floyd was shocked to find the house so bare and
cheerless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you had the covers put on again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dusty. The furniture will be ruined, and
we&#8217;re not going to entertain.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>He didn&#8217;t answer. When he saw the Japanese,
he asked for Ellen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I sent her away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! has she done anything wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! but she annoys me, she&#8217;s too good-looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd feared his wife&#8217;s mind was unbalanced; she
brooded too much over her misfortune. He was
very tender, very indulgent, but sometimes his
patience gave out.</p>

<p>Days, weeks, months passed. Winter came with
snow, ice, sleet. Julie spent most of the time in her
room, rarely going down to dinner. Floyd tried to
get her out for a walk, but had to compromise with
the automobile. She&#8217;d wear a hat pulled down over
her eyes, a thick veil, a long close-fitting coat, and
avoided Fifth Avenue. The house remained covered.
Floyd begged her to take off those ugly, depressing
gray things, but she sat silent, antagonistic;
it always ended in his dashing out, and spending the
day at the club. But his anger never lasted. The
pathetic figure, crouching in a big chair, those weary
lustreless eyes, hurt him terribly; she had lost her
beauty. What is the elusive thing we call beauty?
It is not form, it is not color; it is something that
pervades, like the perfume of a flower in fresh earth,
or a haunting magic in the woods. In a woman it
is a living spark that sets us aglow; that spark was
dead in Julie; he had to admit it. The Image which
he called by her name was blurred; she would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
an old, miserable woman; he, an old, disappointed
man.</p>

<p>He spent much of his time at the club. He&#8217;d read
his morning paper there. He detested local politics.
The society column annoyed him; Mrs. C. had
run off with her chauffeur, Mrs. M. was going to
marry her riding master, a well-known woman was
suing her millionaire husband for more alimony. It
was horrible to have one&#8217;s domestic horrors made
attractive reading; he resolved no one should suspect
his. Then the paper would drop from his hand,
the green Park grow shadowy, fade away; he&#8217;d
awaken with a sense of guilt; a young man dozing
in his chair, and all the unrest in the world. He
would look about furtively; the others didn&#8217;t notice&mdash;they
too were dozing.</p>

<p>One day he went home earlier than usual. Julie,
with the boy in her arms, was sitting at the window
watching the workingmen on the iron frame of a
building opposite; they were knocking, boring, climbing
in and out like monkeys; it was fascinating. She
was conscious of her flannel wrapper. Floyd was
always well dressed, well groomed; his glance was
like a sharp whip. He took the boy from her and
put him on the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child is heavy, you must not accustom him
to be carried about; he makes the house unbearable
with his cries. It&#8217;s all right to be a good mother,
but you are overdoing it; you forget you have a
husband.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>She was on her feet facing him indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you speak to me like that? You have
no pity for my misfortune!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if I have offended you, but I don&#8217;t see
why you should be so sensitive about your hair. You
have become very neglectful; you have lost all self-respect.
I&#8217;m ashamed of the servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Floyd!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to have Colonel Garland for dinner; I
have business with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; I won&#8217;t see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. It&#8217;s not very pleasant for a married
man to be obliged to invite his friends to a restaurant,
because his wife will not take the trouble to
make herself presentable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dinner will be served whenever you order
it, but I will not come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do as you please about that. I&#8217;ll ask
him for Wednesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so soon?&#8221; She was panic-stricken.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother never needed to prepare. Her table
was always well supplied.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this parting shot he went out.</p>

<p>Julie stood aghast; her adoring slave was turning
against her. A man loves only beauty in a woman;
when she loses that, she loses everything. She was
so young; what was she going to do with the rest
of her life? She sat despairing, trying to think herself
out of the network of misery which entangled
her. She couldn&#8217;t, poor thing. The present was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
horror to her; the future, a blank. She went back
to the past, lived it all over again and again&mdash;Martin!
the joy of those secret meetings; Hippolyte&mdash;the
side-door which opened only wide enough to slip
into the dark corridor; there, in Martin&#8217;s arms&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The child cried; she threw herself down beside
him, pressing him violently to her. He struggled.
She held him tightly&mdash;muttering unconsciously, &#8220;My
body, my Soul, my little Martin,&#8221; peering into his
face&mdash;as if seeking something to console her. These
paroxysms of despair sapped her strength. She was
no longer apathetic, but groping, groping for some
remedy. She&#8217;d go back always to those wonderful
days with Martin. She was religious at heart, but
she would have gladly given her hopes of redemption
to be able to look into the mirror and see once
more her young face, her soft dark hair. Hippolyte
had admired her hair; she saw him again, so suave,
so handsome, heard his exquisite French, caught
again the laughing significance of the looks which
passed between the two men&mdash;It was madly fascinating;
day and night it all repeated itself in her
brain, revolving like an ever-turning wheel&mdash;Martin&mdash;Hippolyte&mdash;Pierrot&mdash;the
sweet, pungent odor of
the place; then the suggestion worked. Hippolyte
had often told them of his wonderful salves, lotions,
hair restorers&mdash;he might know a way to restore the
color of her hair. She looked up his address&mdash;took
the receiver in her hand, a moment of fear, irresolution,
then she called the number.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>&#8220;I want to speak to Hippolyte.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oui, Madame, I am here.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice set her nerves quivering.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mrs. Garrison speaking. You don&#8217;t know
my married name, I was Julie Gonzola.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame, I knew your voice. How could I forget
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come and see me today at four? Thank
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was terribly excited. What would he think
when he saw her now? He must help her&mdash;he
must! It was her last hope.</p>

<p>Punctually at four, the boy knocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A gentleman downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrunk away&mdash;she couldn&#8217;t see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says you expect him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a strong effort she controlled the impulse to
send the man away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hippolyte looked curiously at Julie, not grasping
what had happened to her. She was embarrassed,
didn&#8217;t know what to say; then she slipped off her
cap and let her hair down. It fell to the bottom of
her dress. He gasped and broke into a shower of
compliments. His admiration was evidently sincere.
Julie&#8217;s spirits rose; it was not all over.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hair turned white when I was ill. I want it
restored to its natural color; I can give you the
shade&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mais non! Madame</i>, it is quite <i>le dernier cri</i>&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
are bleaching the hair now, but we couldn&#8217;t do it
like this, Madame. Your hair will be the sensation;
it needs a little tonic oil and massage.&#8221; Then he
looked at her again. &#8220;Madame is long indisposed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have been in the house all winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame needs fresh air and the Swedish treatment&mdash;the
beauty will come back; put yourself in
my hands, and you will see!&#8221;</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>The Wednesday agreed on, arrived. Floyd left
the house without seeing Julie; he was getting used
to that; the entire morning she would be occupied
with the boy, always in a wrapper with that disfiguring
cap on her. She bathed, dressed, undressed
the child like a professional nurse. Floyd protested
in vain.</p>

<p>On the way downtown he telephoned the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Madame awake yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Connect me with her room, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie called &#8220;Hello.&#8221; He thought her voice had
more life in it than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie, do you remember I was to ask Colonel
Garland to dinner tonight, but if you are still against
it, I can postpone it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! The dinner is ordered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped the receiver with a guilty feeling.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>Perhaps he had been too harsh. He didn&#8217;t know
what to do about her; he was quite helpless; life
was becoming unbearable.</p>

<p>Colonel Garland greeted Floyd with delight. He
was talking to a tall man in his private office who
came up and shook hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t remember me, Mr. Garrison?&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd took in the tired face, the dark-rimmed
eyes, the deep lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do! Are you still &#8216;sweating blood&#8217; for
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sweating blood to keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A few drops, but I&#8217;ll be bled white if this goes
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed mirthlessly, said &#8220;So-long,&#8221; and left.</p>

<p>The Colonel looked after him, speaking with a
touch of pity and contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow made a million during the War;
it&#8217;s been going the other way for some time, and&mdash;he&#8217;s
got a handsome, extravagant wife. Now&mdash;if
we pull down those old shanties near the river, and
build up big warehouses&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! I&#8217;m not a wrecker; they bring enough
for my modest wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what your father said twenty years
ago. You&#8217;re getting very much like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd didn&#8217;t take that as a compliment. The men
of twenty years ago were a century behind the times.
Then, rather timidly, hoping for a refusal, he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>&#8220;Will you come and take pot-luck with me tonight?
My wife&#8217;s not well; she can&#8217;t join us&mdash;I
must find some congenial occupation. We&#8217;ll talk it
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel was all animation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Politics! We need young men. We&#8217;ve got a
job on our hands to rebuild the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon they went to the Republican
Club for a cocktail from the Colonel&#8217;s private stock.
There were the usual jokes about Prohibition being
a good law&mdash;for others. On alighting from the car,
Floyd was surprised to see the soft red gleam of the
colored glass fixture over the porch. The filmy lace
window curtains through which the light shone were
not there when he left the house that morning; before
he could take out his latch key, the door was
swung open. The Jap in spotless white smiled a
welcome; they entered the parlor&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God,&#8221; cried the Colonel, &#8220;this is something
like. A beautiful color, that velvet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd smiled. &#8220;Mulberry, they call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chairs, the sofa with its cushions, were like
old friends; he saw again those well-loved water
colors; his mother looking down at him, and through
the door, the glimpse of a beautifully set dinner
table&mdash;a picture covered for a long time, once more
in the light.</p>

<p>Julie came swiftly toward them, extending her
hand to the Colonel. She was in a state of excitement,
like an actress who makes her d&eacute;but in a new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
r&ocirc;le. Her color came and went. A crescent of black
plaster deepened the darkness of her eyes. The despised
hair revenged itself with its beauty; it was
mounted in shining, rippling masses on the top of
her head. She wore a soft white gown, embroidered
with seed pearls, a train of gold sweeping the
ground. Her arms and neck were free of ornament;
in her corsage a large red American Beauty rose.
At dinner she kept up a flow of small talk accentuated
by soft glances, winning smiles. The Colonel
listened as if every word were a new truth, the
usual platitudes taking on a mysterious significance.
He was sixty, held himself very erect, could easily
be taken for ten years younger, and he loved the
ladies.</p>

<p>Floyd was silent, trying to overcome a queer feeling.
Was this gracious, smiling woman his wife?
Was he sitting at his own table? Who was he, anyhow?
The Colonel&#8217;s stentorian voice with its agreeable
Southern accent broke in on his confused mental
condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will permit me to tell you how much I
admire your perfect taste in dress. You know what
suits you&mdash;an inspiration to powder your hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; laughed Julie, &#8220;it&#8217;s not powdered, it&#8217;s natural.
It runs in our family to turn gray early. My
father was white at twenty-one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gallant Colonel turned this to his credit.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mistress Garrison, Nature has been
your Fairy Godmother; she has waved her wand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
over your head, bestowing one charm more, the gift
of original beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The evening passed quickly in light persiflage,
Floyd listening as if he were in the auditorium of a
theatre. At the door the Colonel gave one look
back. He could have fought a duel for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk business,&#8221; said
Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who could, with such a radiant vision before
us?&#8221; laughed the Colonel. &#8220;Come down to the
office.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd went back to Julie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for making such a sacrifice.&#8221; It
sounded foolish, but he didn&#8217;t know what to
say.</p>

<p>She came closer to him. He was afraid to touch
her; she was like a strange woman in his house.
That soft sensual smile set him on fire. She slid
into his arms; he kissed her neck, hair, her lips; she
let herself be adored. His love had been ideal in
those early wonderful days of his marriage. He
reverenced his wife; he was afraid to repel her. He
had heard of some men whose wives hated them for
their lack of consideration. Julie laughed at his innocence.
He often wondered if she appreciated being
his first love; he couldn&#8217;t answer that now, after
four years. He ceased trying to probe her soul; he
worshipped her body.</p>

<p>In the physical intoxication of the next few
months, he forgot all his plans for future activity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Love can be a despot or a liberator; Floyd was in
chains again.</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>When it was known the Garrisons had &#8220;come
back,&#8221; they were deluged with invitations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, what&#8217;s the use of Paris gowns if I
can&#8217;t make the other women green?&#8221; She was in
good humor now, caressed, spoilt, every wish fulfilled.
He gave her a new car, a gorgeous thing
fitted up like a boudoir, trying to shake off a sickening
consciousness that he was buying her favors. He
pulled wires for a box at the opera (it was an
achievement to get one); she rewarded him with
a long kiss; he developed a prodigality which
astounded the Colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going it, my boy. You&#8217;re beyond your
income.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sell something,&#8221; laughed Floyd. &#8220;I must
have money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel didn&#8217;t like the flippant answer, the
restless way. He wasn&#8217;t quite certain, but it seemed
once or twice the boy had been drinking. He had
noticed since Prohibition many sober men had taken
to drink; psychologically interesting, the resistance
to personal restraint....</p>

<p>The opening night of the opera, Julie was the
centre of attraction. She had taken the family
jewels out of the safe deposit. A great cluster of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
diamonds set in antique silver shone on her velvet
bodice of old wine, a glittering aigrette in her hair
which was no longer an old gray&mdash;treatment had
changed it into the mat silver which one sees on
the head of a marble statue, with life added to its
charm. She stood in the box in her velvet wrap;
Floyd took it off with a feeling of excitement. He
felt the sensation she created; he was running a
blooded mare for the first prize.</p>

<p>Maud sat in front with Tom Dillon. She had
played her last trump in the game of matrimony. It:
wasn&#8217;t a King now, but a Knave who cared for her;
she was sure of that. For the rest, she looked into
her mirror and saw her future; it spelt wrinkles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that gorgeous creature?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know your friend Julie Garrison?&#8221;
She put up her lorgnette.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has she done with her hair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bleached it. Catch up, Maudy. A celebrated
cocotte in Paris has made white hair the rage; she
looks like one, doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she does&mdash;wonderful. I always said Julie
had great possibilities; there&#8217;s something about her
that attracts men. Look at Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was standing against a post opposite the box.
His eyes fastened on Julie, his mouth twisted into a
derisive smile; the Colonel was there pouring out
his usual compliments. Men were coming in and
out, old club friends of Floyd&#8217;s, all eager to renew
their acquaintance. Julie&#8217;s illness had upset all his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
calculations, but there was one cause for satisfaction:
she had wanted <i>him</i>, <i>he</i> had saved her, she
belonged to <i>him</i>, not Floyd. He was waiting for a
propitious moment; she must tell Floyd the truth.
He waited because he was not sure of her; after a
long siege of fever, the blood cools off.</p>

<p>He dropped in one day at Hippolyte&#8217;s Parlor&mdash;he
went there now to hear about Julie. &#8220;Madame
was going to have a dinner party,&#8221;&mdash;he had made
a supreme effort. The phenomenon of her hair had
given him a great deal of thought. He was in his
way a scientist; the psychic side of it interested him.
&#8220;You must see her superb hair; it suits her to perfection.
It gives the last touch of that &#8216;<i>Je ne sais
quoi</i>&#8217; which she lacked. It was caused in my opinion
by some intense subconscious passion.&#8221; Martin bent
over eagerly. &#8220;A psychic power which acts like the
eruption of a volcano; it tears her, agonizes her, she
struggles with it, is not quite able to translate it&mdash;yet&mdash; Her
husband is a nice fellow, <i>mais vous
savez</i>, Puritanism, the narrow path; he&#8217;ll never deceive
her, nor pardon her if she deceives him. That
little house is no frame for a woman like her. She
needs life, sparkle, passion&mdash;<i>Voila tout!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>During the next few months Hippolyte&#8217;s mademoiselle
brought now and again a deep red rose,
and set it in an exquisite glass vase on Julie&#8217;s dressing
table. Julie asked no questions; her eyes glistened.
She furtively put the rose to her lips; then
she&#8217;d sit for hours under the hands of the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
woman, massage, electric treatment, hot&mdash;cold,
until her body exhaled an indefinable intoxicating
perfume....</p>

<p>Maud and Tom made their way to the Garrison
box. Julie, with a keen woman&#8217;s look, saw at once
that Maud&#8217;s gown, jewelry, furs, were no longer
imitations. Tom was evidently embarrassed and
hung back. Floyd rather liked him; he was genuine;
he didn&#8217;t disguise the fact that he was a rotter. He
said, &#8220;I&#8217;m no good; take me as I am, or not at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been doing all this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! nothing much,&#8221; laughed Maud, &#8220;shopping,
house hunting, getting married; we didn&#8217;t announce
it, it wasn&#8217;t worth while.&#8221; Floyd grasped Tom&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get her, any other way, so we called
on the Judge&mdash;We&#8217;ve been married six weeks; so
far it&#8217;s all right&mdash;I&#8217;m going to buy a house and
put it in her name&mdash;If I don&#8217;t behave myself, she
can kick me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud was sitting in front with Julie, talking over
joining the young matrons and giving a series of
dinners.</p>

<p>Suddenly she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen Martin Steele lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been ill a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s here tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him standing at the back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks awful, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie didn&#8217;t answer. Maud said afterwards to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
her husband: &#8220;Julie was always different from the
rest of us; she was queer tonight, didn&#8217;t hear a word
I said. I&#8217;m certain she&#8217;s not all there.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they were going out, they passed Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with us to the dancing club. Tom&#8217;s sure
to take too much; you can help me get him home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin went, but it was Tom who had to take
Martin home, abusingly drunk, fighting like a beast.</p>

<p>That night Julie had dreams, and talked in her
sleep. She flung her arms around Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you love me just the same.&#8221; Floyd
was a happy man. He had finished his breakfast
and was looking out of the front window, waiting
for his wife to awaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Floyd, Floyd.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went up the stairs three at a time.</p>

<p>She held out her arms to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Floyd, we must move away from here; the street
is getting impossible.&#8221; A crash of falling timbers
next door strengthened her position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie! This is our home; you know how I love
it. How can you ask me such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was losing his temper; she was on the verge
of tears, and last night when he held her in his arms,
he swore&mdash;they all do at those times.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything for you, anything, but my home
is a part of me; you don&#8217;t realize how I love it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than me?&#8221; She was pouting now, like a
child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>&#8220;Oh, no!&mdash;different&mdash;you won&#8217;t ask me to leave
it, will you?&#8221; It was pathetic, the appeal in the
man&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I also loved my home; I left it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about to say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not the same. The
roots of my life are here; you are an alien.&#8221; He
didn&#8217;t want to offend her; then he went down to see
the Colonel, and mentioned with much embarrassment
that the street was getting unbearable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s very unhealthy for your wife and child
to inhale all that dust. We&#8217;ve secured a house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, have you? My wife didn&#8217;t tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she wanted to give you an agreeable surprise.
It&#8217;s on Park Avenue. We&#8217;ve rented it for
the winter.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t add, with the privilege of
buying; that was to be kept secret. He liked to be
in conspiracy with Julie against her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfection; we&#8217;ve secured it with servants,
wine cellar, everything complete.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd went home and compromised with Julie.
The furnished house for the winter only; he was
grateful she had not insisted on going to a fashionable
hotel!&mdash;A camp in the mountains for the summer,
and in the autumn when the street was built up,
to return to the old home. Julie was satisfied with
the bargain. The house would be impossible shut
in on both sides; the walls were cracking; everything
was going to pieces. She would never go back.</p>

<p>Floyd stood at the door of the car waiting for the
&#8220;bunch&#8221; to come down&mdash;the boy, the nurse, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
Pekinese, countless bags, dress suit cases, last-minute
bundles, and&mdash;Julie very much excited. She
had gone back for the little glass vase which had
been forgotten. He was physically tired, mentally
agonized; he cast one look back and jumped into the
car. He had a peculiar feeling: he was the automobile;
Julie was driving.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>The house in Park Avenue was the very last
word; Floyd had to confess that. The walls tinted
a cold gray, the light coming from invisible corners,
telephones, a radio-cabinet, china closets hidden behind
panels; the entire floor could be made into a
dancing hall by pushing the doors into the wall; no
fireplace, very little furniture, meals rolled in ready
to serve by the &#8220;haughty&#8221; Swede hired with the
house, everything cooked &#8220;&agrave; la mode&#8221; by a chef, also
hired with the house.</p>

<p>Julie was hysterical with joy; she had been all her
life the victim of antiques; this was all so exquisitely
modern. Floyd thought with intense longing of his
little home; he vowed to himself he would not desert
it; he&#8217;d go there every day and read his evening
paper.</p>

<p>The house-warming was to be a brilliant affair.
Maud with her restless activity schemed various
plans for a sensational success. Tom sampled the
cellar; it was perfection. Floyd was dispatched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
here, there, and everywhere; Julie sat back and gave
the others carte blanche.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t consult me,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you three will do
it all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the day of the dinner, Julie had been the entire
afternoon in the hands of Hippolyte&#8217;s skilled lieutenants.
He himself was to come later and give her
hair the last touches.</p>

<p>True to his resolve, Floyd had spent his afternoons
in the little house, reading his paper; but he
was beginning to feel a superstitious dread when he
put the key in the door. That day the room seemed
unbearably chilly; he lit the fire with great difficulty.
The wood piled up in a basket was damp, it sputtered
awhile, gave out sighs as if it were in pain.
Soon the fretful flame died out. He couldn&#8217;t read,
looked at his watch, and went home.</p>

<p>The perfume from his wife&#8217;s room pervaded the
house. His room was on the floor above&mdash;they had
become fashionable. He saw less and less of Julie,
she had no time for him; she was wrapped up in herself,
her looks, her gowns; vanity had developed in
her to such an extent it staggered him; she sought
admiration, was a slave to style, adopting the daily
change no matter how extreme; a night at home was
unbearable to her; he dragged himself along; he
wasn&#8217;t jealous of the crowd of men always around
her; but it wouldn&#8217;t look well for the husband to
be absent.</p>

<p>He hadn&#8217;t seen Martin for a very long time. He
was sure Julie had forgotten him, she couldn&#8217;t love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
anyone but herself; he pulled himself up; he mustn&#8217;t
think that way. He remembered her as a girl, so
yielding, so sweet. Illness changes the character of
people sometimes. He must be patient with her;
but life had become very hard; the nights were
spent in carousing. He didn&#8217;t know what to do
with his days until Julie woke up&mdash;and he was only
thirty.</p>

<p>He dressed and went down to his wife&#8217;s door&mdash;his
Mecca; it was open. Hippolyte, with a strand of
her hair over his shoulder, was bending down talking
confidentially. Floyd abominated him; a man
who could make a fortune out of the vanity of
women was despicable; but most fortunes are
directly or indirectly made out of the vanity of
women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Floyd, come in, I&#8217;ve such news for you. I&#8217;ve
sold our house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our little house, to Hippolyte.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie gave him a quick surprised look, and got
rid of Hippolyte.</p>

<p>&#8220;Floyd, you shouldn&#8217;t speak to me like that before
Hippolyte; he&#8217;ll tell the next customer we
quarrel.&#8221; There was a suspicion of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie! you&#8217;re mad! quite mad! What the devil
can he do with our house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll make a fortune out of it, if he follows my
advice; the first floor will be a fine Colonial tea
room; the old furniture and our kitchen coppers will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
be just the thing; the second floor, a beauty parlor;
and above, in your father&#8217;s workshop, a Turkish
bath.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she could sit there calmly and say such things.</p>

<p>The Colonel came in early, poured out a volley
of compliments which put her in good humor. She
whispered to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve won; he&#8217;s getting used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dinner was delayed until past ten, waiting for
Maud and Tom who arrived with profuse apologies.
Tom had been running all day from one shop to
another trying to find a string of beads for Maud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Costly things, those glass beads,&#8221; said Tom.
&#8220;Reminds me of the squaws up in the Reservation,
when I was travelling with whiskey; they had them
around the waist, neck, legs, through the ears and
nose, and by God! they thought they were in full
dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the dancing commenced, Julie was surrounded;
she was the prettiest woman in the room,
and a wonderful dancer. Floyd, in the next room
among some loose fellows, was drinking heavily.
The sedans were <i>not</i> ordered back; chauffeurs gossip
among themselves, and after twelve, the guests
were going &#8220;slumming.&#8221; Taxis were engaged&mdash;Masks
and dominos were put on in the hall, one not
knowing who the other was; Maud had done the
pairing&mdash;she saw to it that husband and wife did not
meet. Tom was to have Julie, Maud selected
Floyd; <i>he</i> wouldn&#8217;t make love to her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>The masked figures in dominos slipped past the
sentinel at the door; he was the devil who was sending
souls to Hell that night.</p>

<p>Floyd wanted to fight everybody, then broke
down and blubbered; Tom had a fellow feeling, put
him in a chair, and told the haughty Swede to look
after him. At the door he got mixed up in the
crowd, found himself with someone in a taxi. A
pair of soft lips met his, he shouted for joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maudy! where&#8217;s Julie?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s in very good company.&#8221;
She nestled up to him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think of her, only
ourselves. Let&#8217;s make believe we&#8217;re not married.&#8221;</p>

<p>The taxis were speeding downtown. Julie took
off her mask, leaned back; she was excited, warm
from dancing. Her companion bent over her. She
looked into flaming eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie!&#8221;</p>

<p>That hour in Martin&#8217;s arms, she forgot her husband,
her child, herself; promised him everything.
This time, he swore, she should keep her word.</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>Floyd had an insane desire to smash things. He
threw a bottle of wine into the glass and china on the
table, overturning the electric candles; the fuse burnt
out, putting the room in darkness. He laughed
hysterically. He was on a ship, in a terrible storm,
the ground was slipping away, billows were rising
on all sides.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>&#8220;Hey there, steward, damn it, where&#8217;s my cabin?&#8221;</p>

<p>The haughty Swede lifted him like a child, carried
him into the elevator which took them up to the
servants&#8217; quarters, unlocked a small door at the
extreme end of the hall; it was an unused room,
with one lamp hanging from the ceiling. He put
Floyd on the sofa, lit the lamp, and carefully
shut the door&mdash;he didn&#8217;t want the &#8220;master&#8217;s&#8221; ravings
to be heard. The caterer&#8217;s men were still in
the house. Some might inform; a raid would lose
him his place.</p>

<p>When Floyd awoke, the lamp sputtered in fitful
gleams. His head was like lead, his tongue parched;
there was a sense of deep humiliation, waves of
shame, higher than the ocean. He looked about the
room. It was in disorder&mdash;boxes piled up in a
corner, a large desk strewn with papers; at the door
stood the Swede.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where am I? Whose room is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a room we keep closed, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The master killed himself here, the mistress
locked the door and gave me the key; she ordered
me not to open it until she came again. She didn&#8217;t
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Paris, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He killed himself and she went to Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes sir, shot himself. He was a fine man, sir, a
very fine man. When I came in to announce dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
he was lying on that sofa where you are, the blood
pouring out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was on his feet, quite sober now. There
were heavy dark stains on the gray rep. The man
answered Floyd&#8217;s questioning look.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s blood, sir, and this and this.&#8221; The gray
rug was stained in dark red; there were splashes of
it on the white wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you put me in here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the house was full of strange people. I
didn&#8217;t want them to see you like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I&#8217;m much obliged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I bring you a little whiskey and soda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No thank you, I&#8217;m not a drinker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that, sir,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;A cup of strong
black coffee will set you all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd looked about the room. On the desk there
was a box half filled with cigars, stationery, postage
stamps, everything just as the unhappy man had left
them. The Swede came in with some strong black
coffee which Floyd swallowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Garland told me to give you this when
you came to.&#8221; It was a large legal envelope; Floyd
took it mechanically, flung it on the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you are ready, sir, I&#8217;ll lock up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd stood fascinated. It was the only room in
that big house that meant something more than
wood&mdash;marble&mdash;The desk was littered, the pigeon-holes
stuffed with papers, the deep armchairs, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
heavy draperies belonged to former days, the man
must have had trouble with his wife about it; she
had put him and his &#8220;old sticks&#8221; in the garret.</p>

<p>The legal envelope was lying on the desk where
he had thrown it. He took out a typewritten document.
The little house was in his wife&#8217;s name. The
Colonel had suggested it as a wedding gift. &#8220;It was
only a matter of form, it was the custom for a man
to put the home in the wife&#8217;s name,&#8221; Floyd laughingly
assented. What did it matter? All he had
was hers, himself included. Here it was in black and
white, sold on easy terms to Hippolyte; at the bottom
was written in her large clear hand, Julie
Abravanel Gonzola Garrison; she had done it without
consulting him; she had the right.</p>

<p>The monotonous voice of the Swede broke the
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a very fine man, sir&mdash;and a liberal man.
She was a beauty; that&#8217;s her picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the desk was a colored print of a woman in
bridal costume, all lace, satin-orange blossoms, an
enormous bouquet half hiding her face; it was like
the wax models one sees in a show window.</p>

<p>The Swede took a photo out of his pocket and
handed it to Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the master; I asked him for it the night
before he died. I was very fond of him,&#8221; his voice
broke.</p>

<p>Floyd knew that care-lined face: &#8220;The man who
sweated blood.&#8221; He shivered. He tried to pull<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
himself together; the horror of it struck him down.
He staggered against the desk; on it lay an open
letter, crushed together, as if thrown there in haste;
his eye caught unconsciously what was written.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It&#8217;s over. I&#8217;ve made superhuman efforts; everything is gone. I
was afraid to tell you the last time you demanded money, throwing
up to me I hadn&#8217;t made good. I told you this house would ruin us,
but you didn&#8217;t care! What&#8217;s the good of a man who can&#8217;t pay out?
I&#8217;ve begged and begged; this is the last time! You said you
couldn&#8217;t be poor, and there are others. That&#8217;s always in my ears!
I see now what a fool I&#8217;ve been! I&#8217;ve spent my best years scheming
for money, and you took it and flung it in the air. I&#8217;ve had
nothing from my life! nothing! It&#8217;s too late to commence again.
Come back! Come back!</p></div>

<p>Floyd shuddered. He looked again at the blood
stains; he saw the man with a pistol in his hand. It
wasn&#8217;t a fair exchange&mdash;his soul for her body. He
sat in the big chair; that other man must have
crouched there with the pistol in his hand. He had
usurped a sanctuary, bought with money what another
had built with blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to lock up the room, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He staggered to his feet, thrust the legal envelope
in his pocket, went downstairs and into the street.</p>

<p>The sedans rolled up and down the avenue. People
stepped out in front of brilliantly lit residences, a
happy care-free crowd, or were they like him, a lie?</p>

<p>He moved mechanically, elbowing his way through
the mass of theatre-goers, gradually getting down
into the business district, quiet, dark. He stood before
his old home, huddled together as if shrinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
away from the giant buildings on either side, unlocked
the door; there was an odor like a crypt. He
struck a match, lit the half-burnt candle on the hall
stand, held it high, peering into the corners, through
open doors, taking in every well-known detail&mdash;the
straight-back mahogany chairs covered with mulberry
velvet, the &#8220;tidies.&#8221; He could see the shuttle
in his mother&#8217;s delicate fingers dancing in and out of
the white thread&mdash;the rag rugs made by his grandmother.
People were hunting for them in little country
villages; antiquarians were reproducing them by
thousands; but these were <i>his</i> rags. He went slowly
up the narrow stairs; the creaking of the boards
used to anger him when his mother was ill. He
looked out at the desolate garden through little glass
panes, just large enough for a boy&#8217;s face. He saw
himself again gloating over the first snow-storm, running
down to the cellar for his sled, his feet dancing
impatiently whilst Prudence tied the soft warm shawl
she had knitted for him about his head and neck.</p>

<p>He stopped at the first landing. The old clock
was covered with dust; he found the key inside,
wound it, set it right; its ticking echoed through the
house; it seemed to him like a human thing whose
heart had stopped for fright, then commenced to
beat again in glad relief. He opened the door of the
bedroom. Here he had brought his bride, here his
boy was born, here he had watched Martin holding
his wife in his arms. On the dressing-table was a
faded rose; it fell to pieces in his hand. He went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
up to his father&#8217;s workshop; the images took on life
in the flicker of the candle light&mdash;the Negro, the
Italian shoe boy, his mother clasping him in her
arms, an unfinished bust of his father, Rip Van
Winkle with his head smashed&mdash;he took it all in; a
life picture, the background stretching out in the full
sunlight of generations, an old landscape. He was
framed in it&mdash;he himself&mdash;that self, simple, sentimental,
ideal, old-fashioned&mdash;the self that was not
cynical, reckless, material, and all the things we call
&#8220;modern.&#8221; He scented the smell of fallen plaster,
felt the shaking of timbers; the wreckers had him
under the hammer, destroying his foundations.</p>

<p>The table was littered with old newspapers and
rags used in modelling; he stood for a moment
motionless, like a man offering a sacrifice on the
altar of his domestic gods, then he dropped the
candle. Little flames started here, there, grew
bigger; the illumination cast a glow over his
mother&#8217;s face. She smiled at him. He shut the
door, groping his way downstairs; at the gate he
stopped to listen to the clear chime of the clock as it
struck one, two, three....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was no trace of the night orgy in the Park
Avenue mansion. He went up to his wife&#8217;s room;
she was in bed sleeping quietly. The soft-shaded
lamp which burnt through the night&mdash;she had a horror
of darkness&mdash;cast a soft rosy glow. &#8220;Was this
beautiful creature lying there, his wife? No!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
No!&mdash;a legalized mistress, and he, a sensualist.&#8221;</p>

<p>In that moment passion burnt up in him&mdash;the
body of love, the Idol, fell in ashes. He took the
bill of sale from his pocket, put it beside her on the
bed, then went slowly up to his room, shut the door,
and burst into a loud laugh.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>The next morning at breakfast he read the press
headings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old Garrison homestead destroyed by fire, a
total loss, on account of Mr. Garrison&#8217;s neglect to
renew the insurance. Fire caused by a cigarette or
cigar stump thrown carelessly from one of the tall
adjacent buildings. The house was a tinder box.
Fortunately, the family had moved to their palatial
residence on Park Avenue.&#8221;</p>

<p>He marked the notices with red pencil, and sent
them up on his wife&#8217;s breakfast tray. He heard the
maid knocking, and Julie&#8217;s voice saying &#8220;Come in.&#8221;
He could see her opening the papers, reading the
marked lines; there was a loud cry and a heavy fall;
he went up quickly. She was lying on the floor
rigid, the paper clutched in her hand; it was impossible
to bring her to. He telephoned for Dr.
McClaren, who came at once. Floyd told him
about the fire in a few words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been a great shock to her,&#8221; said the
doctor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Floyd. The doctor
looked at him curiously, then went into Julie&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>He brought her to, insisted on her resting that
day in bed, and said to Floyd, &#8220;She&#8217;ll be all right.
There&#8217;s no cause for worry; I&#8217;ve seen her like that
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie believed with all her superstitious, secretive
soul, that her hair turning white had been a punishment
for giving in to her suppressed passion for
Martin; and last night in that very hour of burning
joy their house was in flames. &#8220;What did it mean?
What was that unseen revengeful Power preparing
for her?&mdash;perhaps another blow, a physical deformity?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cry of terrible fear, she sprang out of bed,
locked the door, stood before the long mirror examining
herself closely, not like a beautiful woman
exulting over her reflected beauty, but with the fear
of a guilty soul seeking the brand of further punishment.
&#8220;What now? What now?&#8221; Her body was
spotless, like white marble with a delicate tracery of
blue veins. She gave a long sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The reporters besieged the house. Floyd had the
agony of seeing himself, his wife, his child in every
newspaper. The weeklies had colored prints of the
beautiful Mrs. Garrison. &#8220;She might have stepped
out of a picture,&#8221; &#8220;a living Greuze,&#8221; &#8220;the grace of a
French Dame de Salon,&#8221; &#8220;the Art of Conversation
lives again&#8221;&mdash;then the Russian players arrived.</p>

<p>Julie did not get over the shock. Her nerves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
always abnormal, snapped; she sank into a state of
melancholy.</p>

<p>Floyd went up to her room one morning to tell
her he wouldn&#8217;t be home to dinner; she was still in
bed, crouching among the pillows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you waiting for Hippolyte?&#8221; There was a
touch of irony in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent him away. I don&#8217;t want him any
more.&#8221; Then she broke into sobs.</p>

<p>Floyd was glad to get that &#8220;shame&#8221; out of the
house. Julie was beginning to mope again; she
needed fresh air; he would look for a camp in the
Adirondacks for the summer.</p>

<p>Julie brooded about her promise to Martin; the
revulsion had set in as usual; she was again the
mother, the conventional wife. She was afraid of
his anger; she must keep away from him. All sorts
of horrors took form in her diseased mind.</p>

<p>The clock struck twelve. The boy had gone to
the Park with the nurse, a French girl, who spoke
little English; they were late. She saw the child run
over by a car, lying mangled under the wheels; she
was in a paroxysm of fear, a distracted, neurasthenic
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma, see what I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught the boy in her arms, passionately kissing
his eyes, his mouth, his hair, a handsome fellow,
big for his age, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma, Mamma!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>He took from Mademoiselle a beautiful, perfectly
equipped motor boat.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle explained: &#8220;A big dark Monsieur
&#8216;<i>belhomme</i>&#8217; gave it to Joseph.&#8221; He said he was his
Uncle Martin. He taught him to float and sink it.
She couldn&#8217;t get the child away, that&#8217;s why they were
so late. The boy took the boat to pieces and put it
together again, with great dexterity. He was uncommonly
intelligent.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, Mamma, this is the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pressed a spring which opened a little door in
the bottom of the boat; within lay a neatly folded
paper; the handwriting was Martin&#8217;s. Mademoiselle
took the boy away, looking back furtively with
her French comprehension at Madame. A few lines,
begging, commanding her to come with the boy the
following day.</p>

<p>She knew she would go; she couldn&#8217;t stay away.
He would hold Joseph in his arms; she would take
his kisses from the boy&#8217;s lips; her eyes gleamed. She
would go; it would end as it must. She was lost!
Hopelessly lost! She went to the Park every day
for a week, leaving the maid at home; the boy was
always there sailing his boat.</p>

<p>One day Martin took him up suddenly, pressed
him in his arms, kissed him again and again. Julie
looked on, the blood leaping into her face. They
were <i>her</i> kisses. Then the boy put his arms around
Martin, whispering, &#8220;I love you, Uncle Martin,&#8221;
and fell asleep. Martin carried him to the car,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
motioned Julie to get in first, laid the child beside
her, covered him up with the rug, then spoke in low
tones of suppressed pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You committed a crime against me, Julie. That
boy should have been mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>All night and the next day, Julie had one of those
terrible headaches; Floyd couldn&#8217;t bear her moans
of pain....</p>

<p>Dr. McClaren took off his coat and goloshes,
stopping on the spiral staircase to admire the beautiful
colored glass windows. He found Julie crouching
in a chair, her hands icy, her eyes roving
restlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Madame, I&#8217;m sorry to see you in this
nervous state. What is it, tell me? I can&#8217;t help you
unless I know! Is it your husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he is too good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is troubling you? Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Day and night I have a terrible fear that something
dreadful is going to happen; I&#8217;ve had it often,
but controlled it with a strong effort. Since the
night of the fire it has come back with terrible force.
I suffer tortures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you go out, do you feel as if someone were
following you to do you harm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; she had her eyes fixed on the boat. It
seemed to have a terrible fascination for her.</p>

<p>The doctor took the boat from the table, turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
it over in his hands. He was thoughtful&mdash;puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;How perfectly they make these toys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it floats and sinks like a real motor boat.&#8221;
The suggestion gave the doctor an idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like the water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to take a long sea trip, to
Europe, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like it very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll speak to your husband about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I don&#8217;t want him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to go without him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; He leaned forward to catch her words
which came in low gasps. &#8220;I want to&mdash;to slip away
without anybody knowing. If you can persuade
Floyd to let me go alone!&mdash;you&#8217;ll find him at his
club.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor dropped off at the club that day and
spoke to Floyd. He was sitting in the window gazing
idly at the green square opposite; what Floyd
saw there were flames mounting higher and higher;
wherever he went they followed him, scorching him;
the world was one great funeral pyre; the flames
were drawing him in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife is slipping back into the old condition
of melancholia; we must prevent that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor, I do all I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he suggested a trip to Europe, Floyd gave
a quick cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! I couldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>&#8220;I want her to go alone.&#8221; The same look of
relief he had seen on Julie&#8217;s face. A pity; married
so short a time. &#8220;I would like Miss Mary to go
with her, but she is always so busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was on his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll go if I ask her; I&#8217;m sure she will.&#8221;</p>


<h3>13</h3>

<p>Miss Mary was at home in her little flat on the
East Side of downtown. The cry of a newly born
child came through the window. She smiled; her
ears distinguished the sex. A girl fretted, wailed in
a high-pitched, nagging tone; a boy fought, bellowed.
Yes, this was a girl. Mary wondered how
many men she would make miserable; that would
depend on her face. What children men are! They
marry a complexion, teeth, eyes. When they get at
the woman, it&#8217;s too late. Some kick over the traces;
most of them remain in harness from a sense of
honor. The patience married people have with each
other is wonderful, considering they are like dice
thrown together by accident.</p>

<p>She thought of the Garrisons, and drew two lines
on a piece of paper&mdash;one a parallel&mdash;that stood for
<i>him</i>; he thought in straight lines. The other,
broken with angles&mdash;that was <i>she</i>. She wondered if
he understood that mysterious side of his wife. She
saw his eyes, always trying to look happy, his sensitive
mouth trying to say pleasant things. A knock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
at the door startled her; there he stood surrounded
by the bare-footed little devils of the neighborhood.
They had piloted him up the dark stairs. A little
gold-head slipped her hand in his. He bent down
and kissed her dirty face; then he distributed all his
small change amongst them and shut them out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a time finding you, Miss Mary. I&#8217;ve
never been in this neighborhood before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should get acquainted with it; it&#8217;s more interesting
than Park Avenue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poverty is terrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s wonderful; it keeps people human. But
here there is no poverty; the people earn their
living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such as it is.&#8221; He looked around the room.
There was a cot in an alcove, a few chairs, a table,
a shelf of books, and she smiling at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not feeling well, Mr. Garrison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m well enough, but the springs are giving
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must brace them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible, they are broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have to get you new springs.&#8221;</p>

<p>How young she was, how happy, and the bare
room; here was&mdash;no ego that wants and wants&mdash;always
taking, never giving&mdash;no expectations, no disappointment;
Selflessness&mdash;that&#8217;s what kept her so
buoyant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I help you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you will.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>Then he told her of Julie&#8217;s relapse and the prescribed
sea voyage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. McClaren wants her to go without me; he
thinks it will be better for her. You know her so
well; what is your opinion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife is organically healthy, but there are
pathological conditions&mdash;a radical change might do
her good.&#8221;</p>

<p>She avoided his eyes; he was disappointed, but
what else could she say?</p>

<p>He bent a little nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mary, if you will go with her, my mind
would be at rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat silent a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I cannot; I&#8217;ve pledged myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, clapping her hands like a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be married, you mean? Oh! no! I shall
never marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed with her, like a boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you fall terribly in love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even then!&#8221; Her eyes shone defiantly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a promise to myself, and I won&#8217;t be a
deserter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A promise to yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, don&#8217;t you, sometimes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should, or life would become too accidental;
we would be terribly tossed about.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening to me. I am looking
for some occupation, but I don&#8217;t want to get into a
treadmill. The people toil at business, pleasure&mdash;they
do the same thing day after day, year after
year. Life is a habit, a deadening monotony.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew up her knees, clasped her hands over
them, bent forward. She was a quaint little thing;
he had never known anyone like her. She spoke
slowly, with difficulty; the words she had at her command
couldn&#8217;t adequately express her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life is a gift, not a habit. Every day we do the
same things, but they must bring us something new in
the doing. I&#8217;ve often thought, in the quiet of the
sick room, what a privilege it is that I could
sit there and help, when all the millions and
billions of spirits are crowding the universe, and
can&#8217;t get into life; I&#8217;m so glad <i>I</i> am put into a body&mdash;so
happy, so thankful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never thought it a privilege to live, never
thought of life as a gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We depend too much on people and things to
make us happy; we shouldn&#8217;t! Our happiness depends
on no one but ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew what she meant. Julie had colored his
life for a time; now it was grey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never thought of it that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came nearer with a touch of eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>Then she went to the table and took up one of a
pile of opened letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have pledged myself to something which will
take all my time, all my strength, and that isn&#8217;t very
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nursing is gradually becoming a money-making
trade. During the War, women seeking adventure
with little knowledge were extravagantly paid. Now
money is no longer easy, but prices remain high.
Only people of means can afford a trained nurse;
there is a great need. You don&#8217;t know how sick
people are neglected for want of care. I am trying
to bring together earnest women of all classes; there
are so many who want to do something, and don&#8217;t
know how. I have appeals from all over the country&mdash;piteous
cries from women whose lives are
empty; their school will be the bedside of the poor.
You don&#8217;t know how quickly they learn, when their
heart is in it. They pledge themselves to go wherever
they are called, without regard to payment, like
the nuns in the early days of Christianity. We are
getting together a fund to pay their living. When
they are not working they will study, we will have
our own home, our own hospital. It has only been
whispered, but you have no idea how easy it is to
get money.&#8221; She showed him a letter signed by a
well-known millionaire, who guaranteed a large sum.
&#8220;There are many rich women eager to join us, who
are seeking for something better, something nobler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
in their lives&mdash;you don&#8217;t know&mdash;you don&#8217;t know!&#8221;</p>

<p>No, he didn&#8217;t know!</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel very small, annoying you with my personal
affairs when you are doing such great things.&#8221; He
made his way to the door. Life was hopeless again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was agitated, she couldn&#8217;t let him go like
that; because&mdash;she loved him. She knew it now. A
wave of gladness rushed through her. She had loved
everybody all her life, but this love was like a wonderful
magic touch&mdash;transporting her into some
distant fairy world. She stood by the window; he
saw the light on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can manage it. I want to go to London
to the headquarters of the Salvation Army, to
Zurich, to confer with the Red Cross Sisters; if your
wife will go with me, it will not be neglecting my
duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grasped her hand. &#8220;Thanks, thanks. I&#8217;ll
never forget this, never.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw the blood surging up to her temples,
receding, leaving her white. Her eyes were longing,
pleading; they sought his. She was beautiful; his
heart gave a great bound. He stood looking, looking,
stammered something, then turned and went
out.</p>

<p>The next few days he was kept busy about the
cabins, rugs, passports, exchange. There was a feeling
of warmth. He saw Mary standing there with
that look in her face; he saw the woman for the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
time. How wonderful she was! What a wife she
would make! He hoped she wouldn&#8217;t marry. No
man was good enough. He found himself thinking
too much about her; then he went and bought something
costly for Julie. He refused to stay alone in
the house with that French woman. He coaxed
Bridget back to take care of the boy while his wife
was away. He wondered why Julie didn&#8217;t write
to her friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anyone to know I am going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even Maud Dillon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve moved away somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hadn&#8217;t seen Tom about town as usual. How
people disappear when their money is gone and nobody
misses them.</p>

<p>The car was waiting at the door. Julie, with a
throb of pride, took the boy once more in her arms.
The child was beautiful in his velvet suit and lace
collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t forget me, Joseph?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>She placed her photograph on the table beside his
little bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will say good night to me? I will hear it.
I will say good night to you; you will hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother.&#8221; She put the worn Hebrew prayer
book in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will read the prayer I taught you, every
morning, every evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother.&#8221; The boy&#8217;s eyes fixed on her face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
grew deeper; there was a psychic connection between
them. She went back to her own childhood. She
saw an old man, with that book in his hand, his face
lit with religious fervor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie, you will say the prayer I taught you, every
morning, every evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Grandfather.&#8221; She had kept her promise.</p>

<p>The steamer sailed. Mary remained on deck to
get a last glimpse of the solitary man standing on
the wharf. Julie gave Floyd&#8217;s flowers to the steward
to put on the dining table; there was a bouquet of
exquisite red roses in her cabin. When they landed
she wore one in her corsage.</p>


<h3>14</h3>

<p>The earth was thirsty; it poured down for three
days, a slow soaking rain. Martin thought it would
never stop. He walked along the lake in the Park
regardless of his dripping hat. He was aching to
see the boy again, to hear him say in his mother&#8217;s
soft voice, &#8220;I love you, Uncle Martin.&#8221; What a
mess he had made of his life; now he must steal
what rightly belonged to him. He exulted in his
power over Julie. Her illness was a fatality; it was
her mother&#8217;s dead hand that had struck her daughter
down to save her from him. A shiver ran
through him; why was he so superstitious? He
didn&#8217;t believe in anything&mdash;but sometimes a peculiar
feeling took hold of him; there was another life far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
back, a mystery&mdash;something intangible. He walked
hours in the rain&mdash;fighting invisible forces, cursing
the conditions of his life; it all resolved itself back
to the same determination. She had promised to go
with him; she must keep her word.</p>

<p>Towards evening he rang the side-door bell at
Hippolyte&#8217;s, hoping to get some news of her. The
dark-skinned valet whisked off his coat, dried his
dripping hair and neck, and preceded him into the
Turkish room behind the shop. It was Hippolyte&#8217;s
hour of rest before the night&#8217;s activity; he was lying
on a divan, a picturesque figure, in a loose red silk
robe. He waved Martin a welcome with his small
white hand, the diamond, set in platinum on his
finger, flashing rose color in the soft electric glow of
the pervading red.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sapristi</i>, Monsieur Steele. I was thinking of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin dropped down in a deep chair, stretched
out his legs. The aroma of coffee and a whiff of perfumed
opium lent a sense of warmth to his chilled
body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of me? Are you in trouble again?&#8221;</p>

<p>His pipe-dream-visions changed into the cold
reality of a check book; he had often helped the
man out of his financial difficulties, he earned enormous
sums, but the overhead expenses were fabulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;The money is nothing; it comes in and goes out
like the tide. I am at the end, the compass changes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
We must in Life watch for the Warning. We must
train our ear to detect the direction of the wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are superstitious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all are, if we knew its true meaning. Superstition
is an intense sense of the Invisible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin drank the strong Turkish coffee, puffing at
his chibouk. The man was a &#8220;hairdresser,&#8221; but that
didn&#8217;t matter; Martin had no sense of class.</p>

<p>&#8220;My time in this business will soon be over. I
was the only one for years when it was an &#8216;elite&#8217; profession.
Now it is vulgarized like everything else.
There is a clever Russian woman who is taking all
my customers; do you know why? The husbands
are jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin laughed&mdash;he understood that; he would
never allow this fascinating, purring Greek to maul
<i>his</i> wife about.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mon ami</i>, I know what you are thinking; you are
wrong. They talk a great deal about the immorality
of the American woman. It is not so&mdash;and it is a
shame that it is not so. The French woman is
honest; she have her husband, her lover; he has his
wife, his mistress. Marriage is a success in France;
they do not go about divorcing themselves. Here
marriage is a failure, because every woman, young,
middle age, old, talk of love!&mdash;it is only talk!&mdash;<i>mon
ami</i>, talk! talk!&mdash;but she <i>do</i> nothing! nothing!
Why! because she is afraid; the fear is in her blood
from the old times in America, the fear of the &#8216;Scarlet
Letter.&#8217; Oh! she can love, <i>Mon Dieu</i>! and if by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
accident there is just a little false step, she make a
scene, her relatives make a scene, the press make a
scene, everybody make a scene. Oh! your Hawthorne
did not know what harm he was doing to the
future women of his country. The French authors
knew better. La nouvelle Heloise&mdash;Camille, the
heroines of de Maupassant, have set the women of
France a glorious example.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin smiled. The fellow was clever, insolent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how it will end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my imagination doesn&#8217;t take me any farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&mdash;it is easy, she will go back to the pale
face and the straight hair. You will see the little
Puritan again. They have already forbid us the
wine, the splendid opium, the tobacco, silk stockings,
cosmetics, love&mdash;the whole nation will go to bed
at nine o&#8217;clock&mdash;and their money will choke them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin laughed, but the man was very serious; he
put his hand on Martin&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mon ami</i>, you have been good to me. You know
the Figaro has the soul of an artist; I am going to be
good to you. I am going to tell you something you
do not know; Mrs. Garrison will sail Saturday for
England, without her husband.&#8221;</p>


<h3>15</h3>

<p>The Garrison &#8220;shanties,&#8221; near the river, were
kept in as good condition as possible, but time and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
rats gnawed at their foundations. On one of these
the passer could read, with some difficulty, the faded
letters of an old sign, &#8220;Martin Steele and Son,
Established 1830.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since Mr. Steele&#8217;s death, the business had been
carried on by a Mr. Waldbridge, who knew and
followed the old conservative methods of the defunct
Steeles. Young Mr. Steele was expected to
take his father&#8217;s place as head of the firm, but he
stayed away, took what money he wanted, a ridiculously
small amount for a man of his means, leaving
the surplus in the business. Waldbridge had written
several times asking him to come down and look
over the books. Finally, he appeared. He was a
mystery to Mr. Waldbridge; all the young business
men of the day were eager speculators. He had
expected new ideas, a business revolution; but no
such things happened. He would sit about, watch
closely the proceedings, but made no suggestions.
His visits grew less and less frequent.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he do with himself?&#8221; thought Mr.
Waldbridge. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t gamble. He&#8217;s never
seen at the races or baseball games. His name has
never been connected with women. What kind of
a man is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin sat opposite him in the private office,
flung his soft hat on the floor, crossed his long legs;
his hair was disarranged, his face a yellow pallor;
his clothes hung loosely, he was very thin. His
&#8220;appearance&#8221; struck Mr. Waldbridge as very un-American&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
himself being an Erie Road commuter
with all the proud consciousness of a one
hundred per cent Nationalism.</p>

<p>He spoke cautiously of the hard times and unsatisfactory
business conditions. They had advanced
money on large stocks of merchandise; there was
nothing to do but to hold on. If they forced the
sale, it would mean enormous losses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; interrupted Martin impatiently.
&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t go on gorging money at that rate;
we&#8217;d have to vomit it up sometime. No stomach
could hold it; that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing now. Some people
die suddenly from it; we&#8217;ll have a lingering end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Waldbridge laughed uneasily, really a very unpleasant
young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we will weather it. I&#8217;ve been discounting&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin interrupted again&mdash;discounting meant
nothing to him&mdash;although he was flying some moral
&#8220;kites&#8221; on his own account.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do whatever you like; I&#8217;m out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Waldbridge rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can take my father&#8217;s name down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you liquidate the business now, it will mean
disaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no interest in it. I am leaving New
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Waldbridge broke down. It was terrible, a
long-established, respected firm&mdash;wreckage&mdash;pure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
wreckage; that word seemed to have a fatal significance
in Martin&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I count on, say, ten thousand a year for ten
years?&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie was luxuriously inclined, because her heart
had been empty. He would take her away from
cities; they would live somewhere quietly in the
country.</p>

<p>Waldbridge smiled. &#8220;You can always have that
and more if you want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Martin did a wonderful thing, so wonderful
it left Waldbridge speechless, staring at him. Was
the man mad? There was a taint of insanity in the
family.</p>

<p>Martin read his thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thirty-two years old, and I know what I am
doing. I want you to turn this business into a company;
every man in it, from the lowest to the highest,
must have his share. You, of course, will be the
head of the firm. Get a good lawyer and do it
legally. You&#8217;ll have your work, every mother&#8217;s son
of you, to get the old hulk out of the mud; if you do,
you&#8217;re entitled to the spoils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the capital?&#8221; gasped Waldbridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you what I want, the rest I&#8217;ll leave in
business; you can&#8217;t go on without it, can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s the use of talking about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out his hand; Waldbridge grasped it,
trying to stammer out his gratitude, but Martin was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
gone. He dashed out of the place, threw himself
into a taxi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uptown.&#8221;</p>

<p>The New York chauffeur is accustomed to indefinite
addresses. He looked back at the man with his
hat pulled over his eyes, crouching in a corner. &#8220;A
bloke who had lost his wad.&#8221; Then he wondered if
it was a defaulter or a gunman&mdash;some of them
looked like perfect gentlemen. He drove uptown,
entered the Park. There he stopped. He was
hungry; that guy in the corner could sleep all day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin, pitched forward by the sudden jolt,
glared at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Waldorf.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang up the stairs three at a time, too
nervous to wait for the elevator, looked around the
room, which was in disorder; his man couldn&#8217;t keep
it tidy. Martin flung everything about.</p>

<p>He would take nothing with him but a dress suit
case. He caught sight in the corner of an old box
covered with deerskin, tied together with a thick
rope; he had taken it from the garret after his
grandfather&#8217;s death, but had never opened it. He
untwisted the knots, one after the other. It was a
hard job. It hurt his fingers. He took out a pair of
mountain boots, goat&#8217;s leather, with large nails in
the soles. Martin looked down at his feet; they
would fit him. He pulled out an old woollen shirt,
a pair of corduroy trousers, a felt hat with a green<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
feather, a bright colored vest, and red handkerchiefs.
There was a small chamois bag with
strange coins, Swiss money&mdash;Martin examined them
curiously; a pack of old letters, a photograph of a
young boy and girl, a cow, and a high mountain at
the back. That mountain fascinated him; he looked
at it long, intensely. The raw boy and girl in Swiss
dress were his grandparents. Martin thought of
his mother. On the back of the card there was
something printed which he made out with difficulty:
&#8220;Val Sinestra.&#8221; He had never heard the name. He
put everything back in the trunk and roped it; the
idea came suddenly: he would take it with him, to
Switzerland.</p>


<h3>16</h3>

<p>After Julie left, Floyd spent his evenings at
the club; there were many strange to him. The
membership had increased; it was still a mark of
class to be seen lounging at the club-window in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>He missed Martin. He was different from the
others. When he raved against the world, he said
things in bad taste, but often the bitter truth. With
a sudden impulse, he wrote a few lines, asking him
to lunch at the club the following day. He&#8217;d be
furious when he heard Julie had sailed. He&#8217;d say,
&#8220;You might have given me a chance to send her a
few flowers.&#8221; Floyd smiled; yes, he liked Martin;
more than that, he loved him; he was interwoven
with the memories of his childhood, his youth. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
wished that episode had not happened when Julie
was ill, but she was unconscious of it. She had never
in all that time mentioned his name. It was all in his
own evil mind. He mentally asked pardon of
Martin. The next morning at breakfast he had a
feeling of agreeable expectancy.</p>

<p>The boy was crying upstairs. Bridget couldn&#8217;t
quiet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The child fretted for his mother. He had caught
a cold, and had been kept in the house for some
days. He was standing with his boat in his hands,
sobbing piteously. Floyd pacified him by running
the water into the bath which was sunken in the
center of a tiled room. The boy handed his father
the boat.</p>

<p>Floyd turned it over in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;A costly toy. Mamma is good to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma didn&#8217;t give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes she did&mdash;Mamma gives you everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t,&#8221; insisted the boy. &#8220;My Uncle Martin
bought it for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Uncle Martin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He came every day to the Park, and then
he put a note in the cabin, telling Mamma to come,
and she came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the cabin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t find it, nobody but me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy in great glee pressed the spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no letter there!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>&#8220;Oh! no! I gave it to Mamma; she read it and
tore it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd pushed the boy away. He was making a
spy of his innocent child. Why didn&#8217;t Julie tell him?</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Mamma meet Uncle Martin in the Park
every day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not every day; she&#8217;d stay away sometimes
because Uncle Martin scolded her and she&#8217;d cry.
He loved me and petted me and said he was going
to steal me away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you wouldn&#8217;t leave me, would you, Joseph?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy meditated, and then told the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I would, Papa, if Mamma came along;
but I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d come because Uncle Martin
scolded her too much. I was mad at him and said
&#8216;Uncle Martin, you&#8217;ll have to beg Mother&#8217;s pardon;
I always do when I&#8217;m bad.&#8217; Then Uncle Martin
laughed and gave me such a long kiss and said,
&#8216;There, take that to Mamma and it will be all
right.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd sat motionless with the boy in his arms.
The little fellow&#8217;s eyes drooped, he slid down, pillowed
his head on the big fur animal; those glassy
eyes brought Floyd back to Mrs. Gonzola&mdash;why
did she always watch Julie? He had never asked
any questions about the unexpected call on the telephone.
He had been deliriously happy; there was
no room in his thoughts for the past.</p>

<p>He bent over the child, noting the beautiful powerful
body; neither he nor Julie had great physical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
strength. The boy would be a giant. Why did Mrs.
Gonzola press such a quick marriage? Why did she
keep him away so much during their short engagement?
Why did she want Julie to get &#8220;used&#8221; to
the idea? As a child Julie liked Martin better;
they&#8217;d disappear and he&#8217;d wander about looking for
them, then go home disappointed. In his mad
desire to get her, he had really done Martin an
injustice; he should have waited. He didn&#8217;t do the
square thing, because&mdash;he knew Martin would have
won out! He bent lower over the boy&mdash;trying to
find some clue in that innocent face! The blood
rushed to his head&mdash;he must have it out with Martin&mdash;he
couldn&#8217;t go on with evil suspicions of his wife,
his friend. Martin was no liar! He always told
the brutal truth, even if it were against himself.</p>

<p>The night brought sanity, consolation. Julie was
foolish, but not criminal. Her religion wouldn&#8217;t let
her do anything wrong. She went to Confession
the day before her marriage; then he wondered&mdash;what
did she really believe? She was by creed a
Catholic, but she taught her boy his prayers in
Hebrew.</p>

<p>He went early to the club and waited for Martin,
who was late as usual. He looked at his watch, and
idly took up the morning paper.</p>

<p>His eye caught a headline. &#8220;The <i>Aquitania</i> sailing
with a distinguished crowd on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>What! the ship already back and sailing again?
It was the usual summer rush; he knew most of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
names. One riveted his gaze. He read it once,
twice, three times; the paper dropped from his hand.
He saw that name wherever he looked. Martin
Steele had sailed on the <i>Aquitania</i>.</p>

<p>It was ten days before the next steamer crowded
with pleasure-seekers sailed for England. At the
last moment Floyd came on board, too late to have
his name in the passenger list. The only cabin left
was on the lowest deck inside. He went down,
locked the door, unpacked his valise. Most of its
space was taken up by a silver-mounted leather box&mdash;one
would say an elegant toilette case. He
opened it, took out a brace of shining pistols, examined
each one carefully, and put it back in the box.
He had no definite plan, but when a man catches a
thief in his house he shoots him....</p>


<h3>17</h3>

<p>Martin arrived in London and put up at the
Savoy; he noticed the crowds of fine young fellows
and beautifully dressed women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything unusual going on tonight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the polite young clerk, &#8220;a dinner and
dance, in honor of Mrs. Garrison, an American
lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie had been received by the Ambassador in
London with great cordiality, on account of his old
friendship for Jimmie Garrison. Mary wrote to
Mr. Garrison:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You have all reason to be well satisfied with your wife. We
have done the right thing. She is enjoying herself. She looks
like a young girl; the element which disturbed her has disappeared.
I find her so much more normal.</p></div>

<p>The letter never reached Floyd.</p>

<p>Martin stood in the doorway, his eyes fixed on
Julie, who was surrounded by eager applicants, waiting
their turn to dance with the &#8220;silver-haired
beauty.&#8221; He took in the soft white neck, the
dimpled arms, the small classic head, and that something
in the curve of her mouth and yielding smile&mdash;a
triumphant sensuality. She swept past him. He
could have touched her; he stood motionless.</p>

<p>Mary was up early the next morning. She stood
looking at Julie, in a deep sleep, her hair falling
loose, enveloping her in a veil of unreality; then she
shut the door softly and went into the salon. Waiting
for her simple breakfast, she watched the passing
busses and pedestrians in the street below. All
large cities are the same, but different, like people;
each individuality giving another form to the
Image or material symbol. London has a distinct
personality; nobility of character is unmistakably
stamped upon it.</p>

<p>The door opened; she turned and saw Martin.
There was a momentary fear; then she was her quiet
self again. Martin apologized for startling her.
They measured each other; he saw an enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so antagonistic to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m never antagonistic without reason?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>&#8220;What reason have I given you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked keenly at him. He was well groomed&mdash;a
clean-shaven, intense face, fascinating for some
women; he repelled Mary. He has courage to show
his mouth, she thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been sent here by Mrs. Garrison&#8217;s doctor;
she has had a serious illness, you know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may at any time fall back into the same condition.
I don&#8217;t want her to know you are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a gleam of humor in his eyes; it
angered her. Why should she play policy with him?</p>

<p>&#8220;Because your presence may excite her. You are
Mr. Garrison&#8217;s friend. I hope you will take my
advice and not try to see her until she has finished
her cure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What cure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been sent to a place in Switzerland called
Val Sinestra, to drink arsenic water; you see I am
keeping nothing from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very kind, I could easily find out. Val Sinestra?&#8221;
The name was familiar.</p>

<p>She stood with her hand on the door-knob waiting
for him to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Val Sinestra. I will write her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have orders to withhold any communications
which may excite her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Orders from her husband?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>&#8220;No, from her doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes shot fire at him....</p>

<p>He went back to his room, took out of his bag
the bundle of old letters. Yes, that was the name,
&#8220;Val Sinestra&#8221;; it was Destiny.</p>

<p>There were two sides to Martin: a fiercely brutal
realism, and a mysticism, instinctively concealed. As
a boy, he would lie night after night, his eyes wide
open; visions came and faded. It was always the
same struggle with an unseen horror. He would
awaken from a restless sleep, his face damp with
tears. Those days he was very silent; his stepmother
called them his sullen fits. As he grew older
the visions vanished, but he had hours of deep
abstraction, when reality slipped away from him.</p>

<p>He sat in his room, the banal colored post-card
of the two young peasants in his hand. There was
a sudden consciousness of Liberation; the other self
flew out and away through walls, over seas, over
mountain peaks, soaring, soaring. He sat there for
hours motionless.</p>

<p>That evening the hotel clerk handed Miss Mary a
note. It contained one line scrawled on half a sheet
of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am leaving for Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was very glad, she wondered how far it had
gone between those two. The responsibility was
heavy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>


<h3>18</h3>

<p>At thirty-two Martin put his foot for the first
time upon the soil of his ancestors. He roamed
through Zurich; mounted its narrow cobble-stoned
alley-ways, stood before an overhanging house reading
the inscription. &#8220;This house is three hundred
years old.&#8221; The lives of Zwingli, Pestalozzi became
familiar. He read ravenously the history of the
town. He stood on the border of its blue lake,
encircled with snow mountains, &#8220;A Turquoise on a
white bosom.&#8221; Something stirred in him, an inward
convulsion, like the sudden eruption of an extinct
crater; he broke into choking tearless sobs. Martin,
unknown to himself, had the Swiss temperament&mdash;a
people without the gift of self-expression, a deeply
religious peasant race, silent before the mystic
beauty of their mountains. Patriotism, that misunderstood
word, with its medieval clashing of
swords, its uniforms, its medals, has no relation to
the Swiss adoration of the soil. He worships his
valleys, his lakes, his waterfalls; they are living to
him; he has a rage for the mountains; he leaves his
country to seek wealth, but he rarely stays in the
stranger&#8217;s land; nostalgia drives him home; he must
get back to the heights or die. Martin understood
later why his grandfather went mad, why his father
was wordless, why his mother died young.</p>

<p>He tried his Swiss on the <i>portier</i> of the Bauer au<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
lac Hotel, a man of all-round information, a veritable
encyclop&aelig;dia of Switzerland, who could
answer in the many languages of the cosmopolitan
crowd, on its way to and from the mountains.
Martin spoke a few words to him in his grandfather&#8217;s
&#8220;lingo,&#8221; then said, &#8220;What am I speaking,
anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your dialect is Romontsch or Romance. Your
people came from the Grisons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he explained how in the Middle Ages the
Barons and Bishops had oppressed the people, and
how they formed Leagues and fought for their freedom.
The Grisons took their name from the &#8220;Gray
League,&#8221; a heroic band of peasants.</p>

<p>Martin left Zurich by the early train the next
morning; he sat the entire day gazing out of the
window unconscious of the other passengers. A
great moving picture shot before him&mdash;green valleys,
velvet hills, beautiful grazing animals, brooks
changing into waterfalls, cataracts dashing down
dark ravines, mountains growing higher, higher. At
Tarasp he stayed over night to connect with the
stage-coach at daybreak, and spent the evening sitting
outside with the guides, who told him of the
Val Sinestra, where the bandits used to live in caves,
deep down in the ravines, and smuggled wine over
the border. Then they spoke in lowered tones of
the danger of mountain climbing&mdash;of death&mdash;of
miracles they had seen above in the mist, with their
own eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>With the rising of the sun, seated beside the coach
driver, Martin pierced the mountain passes; they
stopped at a quaint hamlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We turn here,&#8221; said the old man. Then he
wished &#8220;Godspeed,&#8221; cracked his whip, and went on.
The coach pitched from side to side, on a perilously
narrow road, but the horses were sure-footed, and
the driver, past seventy, had gone the same way for
fifty years.</p>

<p>Martin drew deep breaths of the fragrant air; he
looked about him. The houses were a mixture of
old Swiss and Italian architecture&mdash;the protruding
windows and little balconies were covered with
bright flowers; in the distance he caught sight of a
picturesque church and cemetery. He entered an
inn with a swinging sign; a rooster flapping its
wings. The spotless floors sprinkled with sand, the
small counter with shelves of bottles, the peasant
girl in the costume of the Canton&mdash;it was all so
familiar. She brought him a glass of wine and a
pretzel, smiling at his jargon. He remarked on the
absence of men.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are &#8216;up there&#8217; with the cows for the summer.&#8221;
She pointed to the green hills, gradually
becoming steeper. &#8220;In those little huts on the top
they make the cheese which they send all over the
world. In the winter the sun doesn&#8217;t come up very
high; it is like a blue twilight here. The storms
howl, the snow falls for weeks. When the peasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
closes his eyes, the avalanche haunts him; if he
awakens in the morning he is grateful to God.&#8221;
The girl went on chattering in her soft &#8220;Romance.&#8221;
&#8220;The doctor goes down to Croire in the winter, but
our pastor stays with us. We have service here
when the snow is too deep to walk to the chapel.&#8221;
Then she put down the glass she was polishing, and
went joyously to the door to meet a tall man, a
gigantic peasant, with masses of thick gray hair
falling to his shoulder. He was long past seventy,
but showed no signs of age. His voice rang out
stentorian, clear. He was warm, wiping the perspiration
from his face with a large red handkerchief.
He looked at Martin with keen penetrating
eyes. Then said, &#8220;Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you speak English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we have many English visitors. Our
children are taught it in the schools.&#8221; He looked
again, seemingly puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin Steele. My people come from over
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Steele.&#8221; He shook his head. &#8220;I know none of
that name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin took from his pocket the bundle of old
letters. One glance at them and the pastor&#8217;s arms
were around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wrote those letters to your grandfather. I
am his brother. You are not an American, you are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
a Swiss. Your name is not Steele, it is Staehli&mdash;Martin
Staehli. The eldest of our family, for generations
back, was always Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin felt a throb of joy; the blood of this fine
old man with the head of a Roman ran in his veins.
He had known only Aunt Priscilla, whom he
wanted to burn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, I am going to take you home with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin looked back at the Swiss &#8220;Madel.&#8221; In
her red skirt and velvet bodice&mdash;an image of
national womanhood.</p>

<p>They walked together down the hill, through the
fields, past the little chapel and cemetery where they
stopped. On the headstones he read again and
again the name, &#8220;Martin Staehli.&#8221; He would
bring his grandfather, his parents and lay them
where they belonged, and he would lie there beside
them.</p>

<p>The pastor looked up at the great mountain,
already casting a shadow over the valley; even in
summer the day was short. The night came early
and lingered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not all here. My son was the best guide
in the Canton. He was lost in a snow-drift up
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the ch&acirc;let with its black beams, centuries old,
still strong, unyielding, he put his hand over Martin&#8217;s
head and blessed his entrance into the home of
his fathers.</p>

<p>Martin stood in the long hall, vaguely conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
of atmosphere. A cuckoo sprang out of an old
clock, chanting the hour; a spinning wheel with
threaded flax; new linen piled up; a living thing,
that wheel, it clothed the people. Carved chests,
plaques of fruit, birds cut out by the natives, when
the country was Italian&mdash;everything in the room
bearing witness,&mdash;a living story-teller of the lives
and times of the vanished family. For the first
time he <i>felt</i> the antique. He was swayed by a kind
of psychic storm, like a rush of wind through the
pass of a mountain.</p>

<p>The pastor at the door called, &#8220;Angela, Angela.&#8221;</p>

<p>A clear voice answered; she came down the path&mdash;a
girl of sixteen, with bits of hay in her flaxen
hair, a child-like look of wonder in her blue eyes,
and something more&mdash;of mystery. Martin thought
of Joan of Arc in the orchard.</p>

<p>On seeing Martin, she gave a quick impulsive
cry. The pastor put his arm around her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What frightens you, Angela? It is my brother,
Martin&#8217;s son from America.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angela extended her hand, but her warm radiance
had vanished. &#8220;Come out in the sun, it is cold
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She brought mugs of thick yellow milk, brown
bread, delicious chipped beef, then went again into
the field and sat sorting out leaves from a basket.
The pastor followed Martin&#8217;s gaze which lingered
on the girl; she appealed to his artistic sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Angela is a wonder child; she is not of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
family. I found her one moonlit winter night in a
snow-drift&mdash;a white angel. Since she came the village
has prospered; the people are happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin smiled: probably the child of some unfortunate
village girl. The pastor read his thoughts.
&#8220;She belongs to no one; she is a miracle-child. You
don&#8217;t believe in miracles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why are you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>A simple question, difficult to answer. He
couldn&#8217;t express the longing, which from childhood
had made him restless, unhappy&mdash;a longing for
some other space, some other element. He couldn&#8217;t
explain his agitation, his unbearable joy, when he
saw those scenes of which his grandfather had
babbled in incoherent broken bits. He answered
conventionally.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to see the place where my grandfather
was born.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor grew very serious. &#8220;It was not a
case of idle curiosity you were drawn here; Angela
knew you were coming. I used to tell her stories of
your grandfather, Martin Staehli. He was queer;
had a streak in him of evil. He got into a brawl
with a guide and killed him; he had to leave the
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew that,&#8221; said Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why he changed his name. I wrote to
him often, but he seldom answered. Poor Martin,
he got very rich.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>Martin laughed bitterly. That almost uncontrollable
instinct to destroy was his inheritance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Angela said the third generation would return
home. She has the gift of prophecy and of healing.
She cures the people of their ills. The cattle run to
her for her herbs; there is a magic in them. She
brews them with Prayer, with Love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin shook off a peculiar feeling; it was all
superstitious nonsense, an insult to a man&#8217;s intelligence.
He rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will stay here with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I must meet some friends.
Where is the Val Sinestra Hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little distance from here, on the other side of
the hill beyond the hay-field.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin looked up at the straight stony walls of
the big mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to climb that mountain,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The pastor smiled. &#8220;Perhaps, when you have
had long practice; a man must train himself to
climb.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor watched him as he went with quick
uneven steps, stumbling here and there; he had no
equilibrium. He&#8217;d never climb that mountain.</p>

<p>Angela was also watching Martin. The pastor
put his hand on her shoulder; she started.</p>

<p>&#8220;He terrifies me; I am afraid of him.&#8221; She
threw herself sobbing into the old man&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>


<h3>19</h3>

<p>The pale women were coming up from the
Springs, where they drank the arsenic water with
a prayer for red corpuscles, strength, beauty. The
Spring of Youth was in a cleft in the mountain&mdash;a
dark mysterious fountain of gushing water unlit by
the sun.</p>

<p>Martin paced his room in the hotel. She was
there, arrived two weeks before; the cure was
nearly over. The madness came back now; he had
been free of it for a few hours. It was like the
relapse of a fever, violent&mdash;vicious&mdash;raging. He
had waited too long for her with stupid patience,
and more stupid scruples. He heard Julie&#8217;s voice
downstairs; he went to the window. She was standing
on the terrace talking to Miss Mary, who was
leaving. She kissed Julie, jumped into the hotel
omnibus, and drove off. Julie stood a moment waving
her hand, then turned and entered the house.
He heard her voice outside in the corridor speaking
to the maid. The next door opened; her room
adjoined his.</p>

<p>The Sun-God sinking slowly behind the mountain
scattered an orgy of color. Julie stepped out
on her balcony. There was a low railing between
them. He jumped over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie!&#8221;</p>

<p>She started with sudden fear, fled into the room.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
He followed, tried to say something, stood speechless
looking at her. She was wonderful. The
force of the rich blood surging under the white skin
swept him like a cyclone. There was a new intensity
of life in her, quick flashes of passion in her
eyes. She gave a low cry, threw her arms out
trembling with uncontrollable joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You! You!&#8221; She kissed him again and again.
How she kissed him! then drew him outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! come! The sun is setting; it was too
wonderful, I couldn&#8217;t bear it alone.&#8221; His eyes
held hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Miss Mary driving away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she has gone to Tarasp to visit an old
patient; she will be away until tomorrow afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shadow fell; it was twilight.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to hold her; she slipped out of his arms,
shutting the long windows after her. He went back
to his room. Those fleeting moments made him
eager, desperate. The night was coming on; they
were alone together at the end of the world.</p>

<p>Miss Mary sitting in the train was troubled. She
opened a telegram and read it again, &#8220;Meet me at
Tarasp. Say nothing to my wife. Floyd Garrison.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>


<h3>20</h3>

<p>The little parlor of the hotel was filled with
guests, assembled there, as was the custom, waiting
for the dining-room doors to be opened. Martin,
standing in the hall, a living symbol of electric
force, created a sensation. He drew nearer and
took in the crowd of pale women, young, nervous,
with mysterious ills they could not, or would not,
explain to their doctor, who, for the lack of a suitable
name, called the sickness &#8220;an&aelig;mia.&#8221; He
looked them over with an experienced man&#8217;s compelling
eyes. Some were very good-looking, would
have been beautiful under favorable conditions, but
they were pale, with white lips and drawn features,
like plants in a dark cellar pining for the sun. He
became amusedly conscious of being the only man;
he finally espied in the garden a rheumatic old fellow,
like the decayed trunk of a tree. He felt a
battery of admiring glances leveled at him. He
smiled, went to the foot of the staircase, waited for
Julie.</p>

<p>They went in to dinner together. The table in a
deep window at the far end of the room was
decorated tonight with an abundance of flowers.
Martin played with his food; he was too excited to
eat, but he was in wonderful spirits. Julie had
never seen him like that; she had a feeling of triumphant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
elation. He was handsome; the other
women were envying her.</p>

<p>He laughingly remarked about the Eden with
one Adam and many temptresses.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all so white, as if frozen in ice; the
Sun-God should come and melt them.&#8221; He
squeezed her hand under the table. &#8220;I am sorry
for the &#8216;good&#8217; women. They sacrifice themselves
for an illusion&mdash;chastity.&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered quickly. &#8220;The woman doesn&#8217;t
think so. It is her religion. It may mean nothing
to you, but for her it is a spiritual compensation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s Catholic,&#8221; laughed Martin. She
shivered, drew her cape around her.</p>

<p>Then he said, &#8220;Look how beautiful! The twilight
is wonderful up here, light mixing with darkness
like two souls. How the valley stretches out. Do
you hear the rushing of waters? They are saying,
&#8216;Give me your body, I will heal you.&#8217; Look! The
mountain has a halo of red; it catches at my throat
and chokes me....&#8221;</p>

<p>He was poetic, inspired. He raised his glass.
&#8220;The wine goes through my veins like warm blood.
If I were a doctor, I&#8217;d prescribe it for the ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh,&#8221; laughed Julie, &#8220;forbidden fruit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; There was a laughing question in
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m cured.&#8221; She drained the glass.</p>

<p>After dinner they walked up and down the terrace
in front of the hotel, like old friends who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
not met for some time and had much to say to each
other. Gradually, the buzzing inside subsided, the
pale creatures evaporated, lights were put out; one
glimmered in each corridor.</p>

<p>He drew Julie into a small summer house covered
with vines, at the end of the garden. The head
waitress brought in wine. He thanked her&mdash;the
Swiss know the hotel business. He slipped his arm
under Julie&#8217;s cape. She resisted, but he held her
close. She could hear his heart beating violently.
Then it seemed as if it stood quite still, but it commenced
soon to hammer again against hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go in,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;They close the
house early.&#8221; She put her arms around his neck,
raised her face to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dark it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s always so before the moon comes up.&#8221;
Then she slipped away. He caught her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you give me a signal?&#8221; It was a moment
of suspense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up at her room; there was a candle
burning in the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you put out that light, I&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>

<p>He reluctantly let her go. She went up the
stairs; he saw her at her window. There was a
white spirit also watching&mdash;the moon, that &#8220;Orb&egrave;d
Maiden,&#8221; chaste as the sleeping women within.
Only those two were living; with them it was Flood-Tide.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>The light in Julie&#8217;s window went out. It was
dark now, the moon ashamed had turned away her
face. He started to go; his feet were lead; his
body weighed them down. What ailed him? He
shook himself like an angry beast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin, don&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice was low, but very clear; did it come
from without or within? He didn&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin, don&#8217;t commit this crime; don&#8217;t rob your
friend. If you love the woman, do not destroy her;
it is one throb more, one desire fulfilled&mdash;and then&mdash;the
Price....&#8221;</p>

<p>At daybreak, the gardener, crawling about,
found the stranger in the summer house, his head
on the table, buried in his arms. He looked at the
empty bottles. The wine of the Canton was strong;
he shook the sleeping man, once, twice. Martin
started up; where was he?...</p>

<p>The hotel was empty. The guests were at the
Springs. A bath of mineral effervescent water
refreshed him, but that strange feeling came again
like a dream which returns in fitful flashes, fragments
of color impossible to blend. He paced the
room; his eyes fell upon the deerskin trunk he had
brought with him. He opened it, took out the
corduroy trousers, boots, shirt&mdash;examined them
critically. His valet had pronounced them &#8220;only
fit for the ash can,&#8221; but that didn&#8217;t influence Martin.
He had them cleaned, folded, and put back
into the box. He drew on the soft leather boots;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
they fitted him. The woollen shirt was light and
warm. Looking at himself in the glass, he saw a
man of the mountains&mdash;real, living. If a man buys
a costume like that, it is only a masquerade; this
was his inheritance.</p>

<p>The omnibus came back from the Springs; he
went down and helped Julie out, seeking in her face
the reproach he deserved. She smiled at him; how
sweet of her! The fact was, when Julie reached
her room the usual revulsion of feeling set in. She
undressed quickly, dropping her clothing in a heap
on the floor, blew out the candle. There was a dark
form below&mdash;waiting&mdash;she stood breathless, her
hand on the knob of the door. Then&mdash;she turned
the key, crept to the window, pushed the bolt. She
was securely locked in&mdash;she slipped into bed.</p>

<p>This morning she looked very girlish in a sport
suit; the short skirt grazing the tops of very high
tan leather boots. A soft hat, pulled down over one
eye, gave her rosy face a touch of diablerie. She
was all animation, joking about his Alpine costume,
casting roguish glances at him; but he felt the
undercurrent of emotion. He adored her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going out for a day in the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t ask, will I go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but you will, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was pathos in his voice, longing; she
couldn&#8217;t resist him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I must rest after the bath and dress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
lightly. The morning here is cold; at noon it gets
very warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent down and whispered, &#8220;Wear white like
a bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the interval of waiting, Martin studied a
map of the Canton, tracing lines from one Dorf to
another, short walking tours through the woods;
there were plenty of little inns where they could
rest. He paced the terrace impatiently.</p>

<p>She came, all in white. A filmy scarf wound
around her head, &#8220;&agrave; la turque,&#8221; accentuated the
Oriental in her. She laughingly drew the long
floating streamers across her face; her eyes shot fire
through their soft transparency.</p>

<p>A little wagon drove up; the peasant boy cracked
his whip and they started off. The road was
smooth, sunlit. They stopped at the Springs, where
Julie made him drink the unsavory water &#8220;to clear
his complexion.&#8221; They were in high spirits, laughing
at simple things, like two children. When they
reached the chasm, the road became steep, narrow,
with dark overhanging trees. Martin drew Julie
close to him; a mysterious something hovered about
them, intangible in its beauty, penetrating, wonderful.</p>

<p>The driveway ended there. The descent into the
ravine must be finished on foot. The lad took a
basket from the wagon and set it on the ground;
then he cracked his whip and drove off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>


<h3>21</h3>

<p>At the Savoy, Floyd heard many flattering things
about his beautiful wife. He was silent, kept
turning over the pages of the hotel register, finally
found the name he was looking for&mdash;&#8220;Martin
Steele, New York.&#8221; Then he wired Miss Mary
and left at once for Switzerland, made quick connections,
arriving at Tarasp toward evening. The
stage-coach from Val Sinestra was expected. He
paced up and down before the hotel, his thoughts
stinging like a swarm of bees.</p>

<p>He had married well, he was a happy man&mdash;in
the world&#8217;s vocabulary.</p>

<p>Happy? A man who marries Beauty lives on a
powder mine. The something which compels
adoration makes a woman unfit for matrimony. A
man can&#8217;t always be on his knees; that&#8217;s very well
at night&mdash;but he becomes a ridiculous figure in the
daylight.</p>

<p>The coach shambled up the road. Mary was the
only passenger; she nodded and smiled at him. He
helped her out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you surprised to get my telegram?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You understood?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary waited. She wasn&#8217;t sure how much he
knew.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>He spoke again excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did Dr. McClaren send my wife to Europe
without me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Garrison wanted it; there was no peace
for her with that man so near.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was watching her keenly. Did he think she
was in collusion with his wife against him? Her
face burned; she looked straight at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Garrison, it was an experiment and very
successful. She is cured.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was ashamed. She and the doctor knew his
dishonor, and then&mdash;the world. His voice was hot&mdash;angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;He followed her to London; they were together
at the Savoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she told him of her encounter with Martin,
and how he went away without seeing Julie.</p>

<p>He had done them a terrible injustice? He was
piteously grateful, held her hands, made a foolish
attempt to kiss them. She grew very pale, and said,
&#8220;Oh! Mr. Garrison!&#8221; He dropped them, very
much embarrassed, looked at his watch. It was
already ten o&#8217;clock; the evening had passed quickly,
in spite of his misery.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are tired. I have been inconsiderate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, but if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll go to my
room now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood at the foot of the stairs looking after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
her; she smiled back at him. She was glad she had
been able to bring him a hopeful message.</p>

<p>They started off the next morning, in a comfortable
open carriage. Mary told him funny stories
about the &#8220;blood-poor&#8221; women and their arsenic
intoxication, showed him pretty twists in the splendid
road built by the Romans. They stopped at a
little inn for a bite of cheese and a glass of beer.
He planned a trip to Lugano and over the lake to
Italy; he was in good spirits; the sense of relief
acted like a strong stimulant.</p>

<p>Mary was very loyal to Julie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Garrison, I can assure you everything is all
right. I have written to Rome at Mrs. Garrison&#8217;s
request. After her cure she has plans to go with
you to visit Father Cabello.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd was very penitent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to know that. Father Cabello has a
strong influence over my wife. She has been too
worldly; I hope he will bring her back to religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>On arriving at the hotel, Mary went at once to
Julie&#8217;s room; it was in great disorder&mdash;everything
scattered about, as if she had dressed very hurriedly.
Floyd downstairs was questioning the
woman manager.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame had gone with Monsieur Steele; they
had taken luncheon with them. Did Madame
expect Monsieur Garrison?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I wanted to surprise her. Do you know
where they went?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>&#8220;Yes. The boy who drove them is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to find them, if possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman went to order the wagon.</p>

<p>Mary was pale, agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Garrison, when I left your wife, Mr.
Steele was not here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t answer; he frightened her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Find her and bring her back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A storm is brewing,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;They
come up quickly and are terrible while they last.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wagon drove up; he jumped in. Mary stood
watching him till he was out of sight. The clouds
gathered; the wind slunk into its den.</p>

<p>Floyd pushed back his hat, wiped the perspiration
from his forehead; it was stifling.</p>


<h3>22</h3>

<p>The lovers stood together on a grassy plateau,
the sun poured bright beams of light; below was a
dense mist.</p>

<p>&#8220;How wonderful,&#8221; said Martin. &#8220;Nature has
kept a sunny spot for us; we&#8217;ll stay here awhile.&#8221;
He drew his &#8220;lodin&#8221; cape around him, stretched
himself out on the grass, looking up at the golden
clouds surrounding the sun, looking below at the
rapidly rising veil of gray; it was glorious.</p>

<p>Julie took bread, fowl, wine out of the basket;
they ate with their fingers and drank the wine out
of the bottle. The sun glimmered red through the
dark clouds. They were silent; then he spoke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
quietly at first, becoming gradually very much
excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you throw me over so heartlessly,
after you promised me to prepare your mother? I
knew it was useless; I had made all my arrangements&mdash;I
had a cabin engaged on a French
steamer&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie tried to justify herself, then began to cry
hysterically; she had never broken faith with him.
He couldn&#8217;t imagine what she&#8217;d been through all
her life. The pressure of those two terrible religions:
her grandfather dragging her one way, her
mother threatening her with eternal punishment.</p>

<p>He tried to soothe her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Julie, I&#8217;ll make it up to you. You
will be happy for the first time in your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Floyd&mdash;he&#8217;s been so good&mdash;you always
came between us, pushing him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She slipped out of his arms. It was Floyd now
coming between them, it wasn&#8217;t so easy to push <i>him</i>
away. They had been friends so long. Floyd was
the innocent victim. Martin&#8217;s eyes roved restlessly&mdash;and
that gray mist&mdash;rising!&mdash;rising!</p>

<p>She waited for him to speak; then she went to
him like a child, piteous, pathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin, don&#8217;t be angry with me&mdash;I love you&mdash;but
the winter here is cold; the snow is like a winding
sheet&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t bear it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was wavering again; it brought him back,
fiery, impatient&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>&#8220;We will go to Lugano, Italy, Spain; you will
get your divorce, I will marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&mdash;there is no divorce in the Church&mdash;I
am afraid of Father Cabello.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those fear thoughts&mdash;how they tore at her!</p>

<p>He took her in his arms, kissed her until the
color came back to her face, the warmth to her
body. She was his absolutely; he could make her
do what he wanted&mdash;but&mdash;he mustn&#8217;t leave her.</p>

<p>Then she gave a sudden cry. It was like an
animal in pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now? What now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy! You won&#8217;t let them take him away,
you must promise me that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie, look at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her heavy lids and met his searching
glance; their souls questioned mutely, answered
mutely. He drew her closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have your boy. I promise you. Are
you satisfied now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was tired, beaten to exhaustion by the force
of rushing psychic waves, breaking against her weak
will. Her head throbbed; she tore off her scarf;
her hair dropped in a thick coil, down her back,
like a writhing white snake; he wound it around his
neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was my punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! Our love was not a crime. You
fought too hard against it. Nature put her hand on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
your head and turned your hair white; it was her
revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie listened, fascinated; he was irresistible like
that, his voice vibrating. Every nerve in her body
responded. He stroked her forehead softly, the
pain ceased. How happy she was! how happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a woman of the Orient; you are starving
for love; it is your life&mdash;you cannot fight it; it
is too strong for you&mdash;for me, come! come!&#8221;...</p>

<p>These children of passion went down into the
mist.</p>

<p>He carried her along in his strong embrace, lifting
her over the stones, her feet scarcely touching
the ground; there was a wonderful sense of lightness,
as if she had thrown off a heavy load. The
fog was cold; it dampened her face, her hair. They
reached the bottom of the ravine; the clouds
around them moved, disclosing a little wooden
house, which had been hidden in the mist. Now it
stood out clearly&mdash;a bit of beautiful old architecture.
Julie shrank away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a chapel; see, over the door, the cross.
Take me home! take me home!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, you must get over your religious
superstition. The chapel will shelter us from the
storm. Come, let us go in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&mdash;not there!&#8221;</p>

<p>She fled, he followed her; the mist dropped like
a curtain between them, growing thicker, thicker.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>&#8220;Julie, where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard her voice close to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her in his arms, wrapped his cape about
her; she clung to him. He was deliriously happy;
he held her in a frenzy of possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie, my love! my love!&#8221;</p>

<p>The mist rose slowly, the red rays of the setting
sun penetrated into the ravine, they were enveloped
in flames. He could see her face now distinctly as
she lay in his arms.</p>

<p>The mist vanished like magic, and&mdash;there&mdash;there!&mdash;he
saw&mdash;no! no!&mdash;it couldn&#8217;t be!</p>

<p>Floyd&#8217;s voice rang out through the pass, struck
the mountainside, and came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin held her with a fierce joy. He would
stand now in the open for what he was. Julie was
crying pitifully. He was very tender. He soothed
her like a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Hush! It is better; there will be no
more lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd&#8217;s first impulse was to drag her from Martin&#8217;s
arms, but he stood motionless listening to her
sobs. Then she tore herself away, with an appealing
cry. &#8220;Floyd! Forgive me! Forgive me!&#8221;</p>

<p>That set both the men on fire. Martin gave an
angry growl.</p>

<p>Again Floyd&#8217;s voice rang out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>&#8220;Julie, you are my wife. You must come with
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s silence, the trees motionless, the
clouds sullen, waiting; then the voice of Nature, so
long suppressed, broke out in Julie.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! I belong to Martin! I will not
leave him! I cannot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin stood a little above her, he put out his
hand to draw her up, she smiled at him. God! her
joy!</p>

<p>Floyd raised his pistol, fired; Martin&#8217;s arm fell
to his side. Now burning with a murderous rage,
he sprang forward at closer range.</p>

<p>&#8220;This time through the heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cry of horror, Julie wrested the pistol
from his hand. It fell some distance away, went
off, reverberating through the valley, arousing the
people. The pastor heard it in the little chapel,
where he had gone at the approach of the storm.
He came holding up his lantern, seeking the cause.
A fierce gust of wind blew through the ravine,
whirling, in a dervish-like dance of fiendish fury.</p>

<p>Then the demon in Martin went out to meet the
tearing forces of nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool! Fool! You cannot hold her! She was
never yours! never! She is mine by Nature&#8217;s
unalterable law!&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd&#8217;s agonized tones rose above the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie! Julie! I want to save you from a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
fate! look at him! Can&#8217;t you see! He is
mad! mad!&#8221;</p>

<p>That word struck Martin a fatal blow. He put
his hand to his head; there was a look in his eyes
like a stricken beast pleading for mercy. Floyd
never forgot it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&mdash;not that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and fled, stumbling over rocks,
through bushes, a terrible horror pursuing him,
stretching out its giant claws to entangle him
Mad! Yes, he was mad! It was his inheritance!
The storm raged, crashes of thunder, flashes of
lightning; an enormous tree sprang into the air, its
great quivering limbs cleft in twain. The pines
wailed, muttered, waved their long arms; he staggered
on, fighting the elements without, within. He
was conscious of climbing; his strength grew; fear
made him superhuman. He heard a voice behind
him calling. Mad! Mad! He went on crashing
through obstacles, going up! up&mdash;there was no
measurement of time, of distance. He stood on the
first peak of the great mountain. It rose before
him, a straight wall of stone; a deep chasm yawned
between. He threw out his arms with agonizing
longing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up there! Up to the top!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no trace of mist. The air was cold,
the sky studded with brilliant planets; their light
searched his soul. He saw clearly the jungle within
him, the tearing beasts of passion, the wreckage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
the futility, the dark future! He raised his head to
that glory once more; then with a cry of despair he
went over the precipice.</p>


<h3>23</h3>

<p>The pastor followed Martin to the foot of the
mountain. He could go no further; the ground
was slippery, dangerous. He retraced his steps
with a heavy heart. He was filled with righteous
anger. One of his name had dishonored a
woman; he must make restitution. He found Julie
in a frenzy of fear, calling again and again, &#8220;Martin!
Martin!&#8221; She stood like a white spirit, erect
in the storm. The lightning rent the clouds; then
the floods came down.</p>

<p>They carried her to the shelter of the chapel.
The little building, centuries old, was originally a
storehouse for contraband, a refuge for bandits
who hid themselves from the gendarmes, among
the wine barrels, in the caves beneath. When the
Church took it, they brought a beautiful altar from
Italy, and artists who painted religious figures on
the walls. The wine caves were partitioned into
cells, where pious monks prayed and rubbed their
rheumatic limbs. Finally, this holy place, a victim
of skeptical times, was used as a theatre, where
allegorical plays dealing with the political and religious
history of the country were performed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>When Julie became conscious of the dimly lit
altar, with its faded velvet and gold lace, its figure
of the Virgin in painted wood, she stood transfixed;
she saw herself on the day of her confirmation, her
mother putting around her neck a gold chain and
cross, she heard her own voice repeating the Confession
of Faith, the organ pealing the Hymn of
Praise, the lights, the Presence! With a cry of
anguish she fell on her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy Mary, Mother of God, have pity!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a deep, tender voice filled the chapel&mdash;the
voice of Father Cabello.</p>


<h3>24</h3>

<p>Father Cabello was a mystic. Brought up
within the walls of a monastery, dedicated to
Heaven from his birth, he saw the will of God in
every event of his kaleidoscopic existence. He had
travelled much, studied much, with the one ever-dominating
ambition, which slowly but inevitably
came to its fulfillment. The Gonzola family, with
money and influence, had in those two generations
been a great Catholic influence in America. Father
Cabello was the power behind it. He had sustained
Mrs. Gonzola, that devout, pious woman, in
her awful struggles with Joseph Abravanel. He
loved Julie, held himself responsible for her soul.
He would save her, as he had saved her mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>He had been ill in Rome, stricken down with
fever, caught in the unsanitary quarters, trying to
improve the deplorable condition of the people; he
went down under a hopeless task. Many a night,
seated at his luxurious table, with its rich appointments,
its costly wines, a terrible thought would
come again and again: Was the poverty of its
children a curse laid upon the Holy City, for the
generations of intolerance&mdash;its auto-da-f&eacute;, its crusades?
He tried to drive those haunting spirits
away; he was not the Judge, only an insignificant
part of an indestructible Institution, a symbol, the
moulded image of an Iron Will. Delirium consumed
him. He was for weeks near death; then
came very slowly back to life. Lying on his flowered
terrace, the great panorama of Rome before
him, he thought of Julie. She had written to him
often after he left America, but her letters grew
less frequent. Before his sickness he had received
a short note from Mary, telling of Julie&#8217;s second
collapse and her trip to Switzerland: the arsenic
waters at the Val Sinestra had helped her wonderfully;
the cure would end July twenty-second.
There was apparently nothing to cause uneasiness
in the letter.</p>

<p>Father Cabello was ostensibly of Jesuit origin,
but he possessed a much older secret inheritance
from the time when his ancestors were noble
Spanish-Maranos, deeply versed in deception and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
the Talmud. He scented the trail of disaster.
Why had not Julie written to him herself? Why
had she travelled to Europe without her husband,
her child? Why? Why?</p>

<p>The doctors advised him to go on a visit to
America, where the climate would drive the malaria
out of his system. He refused; his strength was
not equal to so long a journey. Then they advised
Disentis in Switzerland&mdash;one of the few strong-holds
left to the Church. He was haunted with the
thought of Julie. He would go to the Val Sinestra
and see for himself.</p>

<p>Disentis&mdash;its crumbling piles of stone, monasteries
of the seventh century, its stillness, its health-giving
air, the wonderful healing waters, gushing
from the earth into natural rock basins, hollowed
out by Nature&#8217;s hand, the frugal fare, the rising at
the first glimpse of dawn, the pervading sweetness
of the bells, prayer, which had a new sanctity, as
if nearer the Divine Fount&mdash;there he gained new
spiritual inspiration, new physical strength&mdash;there
during the summer months the Benedictine Friars
welcome their brothers from all corners of the
world. Father Cabello clasped hands with monks
of many orders. The Trappists appealed strongly
to his affection&mdash;bare-footed, humble, rich in knowledge;
he never tired listening to their many colored
experiences. He was eagerly questioned about
America, &#8220;the land of unbounded possibilities.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
He had a store of humorous stories, which were
greeted with low chuckles and spasmodic movements
of the diaphragm.</p>

<p>Walking with the Father Superior one day, in
the surrounding woods, that benign forest which
protects the children of God from the avalanche,
Father Cabello asked about Val Sinestra and how
he could get there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easily from here; my carriage is at your disposal&mdash;a
drive at leisure through the mountains, a
most beautiful and interesting trip. Near the Val
Sinestra, there is an ancient bit of architecture, a
deserted chapel; it is now the property of a poor
community headed by a great man, Pastor Staehli;
the Church should buy it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see to it,&#8221; said Father Cabello.</p>

<p>The next day he started out; there was no trace
of anger in the blue sky, but the driver pointed to
a small watery cloud low on the horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to have a storm; would it not be
better to wait until it is over?&#8221; said the Superior.</p>

<p>Father Cabello hesitated, then he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to be at Val Sinestra before the twenty-second.
I am being pushed by a strong impulse,
which has some mysterious significance&mdash;a call for
help from one I love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go, in God&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>That drive through the mountains was a sacrament.
Father Cabello bowed before a great God,
clothed in a sacerdotal vestment of Nature.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>&#8220;There is the chapel,&#8221; said the driver. It was
distinctly visible in the valley below.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot rang out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver shook his head. It seemed to the
excited imagination of the priest like a discharge
signalling a great battle; then the fury of the Invisible
broke, the man whipped up his horses, and
dashed down the incline toward the chapel....</p>

<p>It is wonderful in the mountains after such an
outbreak of electric force; the Prince of Light
marches majestically in the Heavens showering
gifts of prismatic gold; a Master Chemist, he will
create again from the storm wreckage; the stricken
trees will sink into the bosom of the earth and
moulder there, generating in Nature&#8217;s crucible new
germs of Life, and the little dark pine-children will
be born.</p>


<h3>25</h3>

<p>Floyd paced restlessly outside the chapel, listening
to Julie&#8217;s sobs and the voice of the priest,
tender, persuasive, stern, threatening. Once before
he had pleaded with Joseph Abravanel; now a
second time he is pleading with his wife! His
wife? No! No! Lies! Lies! She was never
his; she belonged to Martin by the unalterable law
of Nature. They would go on saying that. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
would always see them with their arms around each
other. He had been cheated! cheated!</p>

<p>A sharp bolt of light pierced the dark valley,
shone on the battered cross above the chapel,
glanced off, lit up the silver trimmings of the pistol
on the ground. He picked it up. The voices in the
chapel rose and fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go back to your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. I belong to Martin; I will never
leave him. I cannot.&#8221; Her voice was sharp with
agony. Floyd shuddered; why should she be tortured
like that? Why? If he were dead they
could live. He <i>was</i> dead, burnt to cinders. The
tongues of flame in his father&#8217;s workshop had crept
into his body, consumed it; there was nothing left
but the shell&mdash;easy enough to put an end to that
clay image!&mdash;&#8220;Shoot its head off!&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor wrested the pistol from the hand of
the distraught man, led him through a trail to the
ch&acirc;let, and left him with Angela. He was quiet
now; he lay back in a chair with closed eyes. She
sat and watched him, passing her cool hand over
his hot forehead; the lamp shed a soft glow over
the pale face, the well-shaped head, the regular features.
A splendid human species, those Americans&mdash;a
youthful race, a type ennobled by climate, good
food, and labor that develops character. She
thought of the cretins of her own beautiful land, of
the degenerating races of Europe. This man was
like Dresden china, fine, very fine; but there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
deep lines that made the face look old; the chisel
of Life had cut deeply into him. She bent over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked blankly into her soft radiant eyes.
Who was she?</p>

<p>She took him up the narrow stairs into a small
room with bare white walls, a little cot, a bunch of
Alpine roses on a table by the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you try to sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221;</p>

<p>She led him to the balcony, a nest under the overhanging
roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit here; you will sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put him in a reclining chair and left him.</p>

<p>The moon shone on his flushed face; the valley
was filled with soft shadows; the mountain raised a
luminous head. The air penetrated his agonized
body. An hour passed; a white figure stood beside
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in! The night air in the mountains is too
strong for strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw her through a mist, his eyes dim with
overpowering sleep. He fell on the cot&mdash;she covered
him with a warm blanket....</p>

<p>The pastor called the guides together; they came
with their ropes and axes. He spoke tersely; they
were used to action, not words.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man had gone up the mountain in the storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he gave a low whistle. There was a panting,
a breaking through the bushes. A dog threw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
himself upon the pastor, who bent over him, stroking
his thick coat with a magnetic touch. He gave
him Martin&#8217;s mantle, the dog tore at it, dropped it.
The pastor whispered, &#8220;Find him.&#8221; With a low
whine the animal plunged into the thicket, the
guides followed, their strong throats propelling
sounds that echoed to the unscaled heights.</p>


<h3>26</h3>

<p>The hotel was in an uproar. The pale women,
excited by the storm, could not be kept in their
rooms; they crowded the corridors, uttering plaintive
cries. The quick flashes of lightning revealed
little groups huddled together; one poor thing quite
lost her control. She betrayed her terror in a
strangely interesting manner: rushed to the long
door opening onto the balcony, baring her white
bosom to the storm. She was wonderful as she
stood there, her face rapturous, like a woman lifting
herself to the embrace of her lover.</p>

<p>The storm passed. The pale women fluttered in
the sun, holding up their bloodless hands to its
warmth, chattering, laughing over their &#8220;thrilling&#8221;
experience.</p>

<p>Mary was terribly worried about her friends.
The carriage had not come back. The proprietress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
thought the party had been driven through the
short cut to the pastor&#8217;s ch&acirc;let.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the shot!&#8221; said Mary. The woman looked
grave. It was not hunting time.</p>

<p>When the carriage drove up with Julie and
Father Cabello, Mary knew something terrible had
happened. She grew very pale, but she had been
trained to ask no questions. Julie was quiet, with
wide-open horror-filled eyes. Father Cabello took
Mary&#8217;s hand and spoke gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been an accident. Mr. Steele has
been lost in the storm; they are looking for him.&#8221;
She caught her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Garrison?&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest pierced her with his understanding
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Garrison is safe; he and his wife will leave
here by the early train tomorrow. Will you see to
everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mary.</p>

<p>Then his voice hardened.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter what happens, they must go; nothing
can prevent that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie let herself be undressed and fell into a
lethargy. Mary tried several times to awaken her;
she would open her eyes and fall again into that
trance which was not sleep.</p>

<p>The pastor came over to the hotel to see Father
Cabello. They talked long into the night, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Floyd, Julie, of the fight against Martin. The
pastor repeated again:</p>

<p>&#8220;He is one of ours; he has done wrong. He
must make restitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Cabello was troubled. Julie had shown
unexpected strength. He must find a way to bring
her back to the Church, to submission.</p>

<p>The next morning, early, Mary was surprised to
find Julie up and dressed. The hotel was closing
that day. The trunks had to be locked and taken
down. Julie watched her moving about.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could get out of this room&mdash;it is horrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hotel room before the departure of its occupant,
with its torn newspapers, remnants of food,
bedclothes thrown in a heap&mdash;there is nothing more
desolate, more inexpressibly forlorn.</p>

<p>They went down to an empty room on the
ground floor, misnamed the &#8220;children&#8217;s playroom.&#8221;
The pale women were unmarried or childless.
Julie moved continually from one window to another;
when she saw Father Cabello and Floyd
coming up the walk, she shrank into a corner, a terrified
hunted thing.</p>

<p>Father Cabello found Floyd very quiet; whatever
may have been his feelings, he had them under
perfect control. He answered the priest&#8217;s questions
in as few words as possible, and listened without
comment to his sophistical justification of Julie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps your wife was not all to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>&#8220;You know Julie&#8217;s nature&mdash;she is easily influenced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man must have persecuted her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to blame <i>you</i>, but knowing what
has happened and the desperate character of the
man, was it right to let your wife travel alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was not right. But it didn&#8217;t occur
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they entered the room, Floyd stood quietly
at the door. The priest went to Julie and took her
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julie, you must ask your husband to forgive
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer came again:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. I belong to Martin; I will never
leave him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest&#8217;s wrath was terrible. He stormed,
threatened, pleaded&mdash;she must go with her husband;
there must be no scandal. She must go home
to her child.</p>

<p>Floyd was white to the lips&mdash;Mary couldn&#8217;t bear
it. She rushed out of the room....</p>

<p>The pastor came up the terrace; Father Cabello
went out to meet him and brought him in. He
spoke quietly, with deep feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guides who were seeking Martin Steele
have come down from the mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they found him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>&#8220;Yes. He is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence. It was Floyd this time who
cried with a rush of repentant agony:</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin! I killed him! I am a murderer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! he himself was responsible. He met the
fate of the rash. A man must know the precipices
and how to avoid them before he tries to climb.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again came the cry from Floyd:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shot to kill! I shot to kill!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The guides followed his traces up the mountain;
there were signs that told a human thing had
passed. He must have gone over at the first
plateau. They went down as far as they dared.
There were broken branches; the violence of the
fall tore up a young tree with its roots. Come with
me, I will show you where he struck the trail.
There was madness upon him, his senses wandered,
the inevitable happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood in the quiet woods and looked up at
the wall of stone where Martin had said, &#8220;I will
climb that mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor put his arm around Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, you have been through more than your
share of trouble; don&#8217;t burden yourself with morbid
self accusations. He was your friend; he betrayed
you. He made the only reparation&mdash;death. Try
to think kindly of him. Under natural conditions
he would have been a brave son of the soil. He
was robbed of his birthright....&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>Julie shed no tears. The old fear was upon her;
the Punishment had come again in the shape of
Death, and <i>he</i> had paid. The priest worked upon
this superstitious dread; it was the only way to subdue
her. &#8220;God had punished her for her crime
against her husband. He would punish her further;
she must go home, she must go back to her
religion, God had struck Martin with the whip of
retribution. He would bring it down upon her
shoulders if she did not repent. A great calamity
would happen to her child.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was cowed, humble, on her knees before him
begging for mercy. He confessed her, and gave
her absolution.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Garrison left by the afternoon
train; they were a pitiable sight, these two unhappy
children wondering why the world was so dark, the
pain so hard to bear. The priest spoke the last
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;My children, you are going home. You will be
happy again, if you do not nourish your misfortune.
God has given us the magic of memory, and a still
greater blessing, the gift of forgetting.&#8221;</p>

<p>They bowed their heads to his blessing. The
train left the station, wending its way in and out of
the tunnels.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I watch those undulations,&#8221; said the
pastor to Father Cabello, &#8220;I think of a serpent
crawling into the great centers of vice, carrying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
with him the modern Adams, the curious Eves,
who will eat copiously of the fruit of the Tree of
Knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest smiled. The simile appealed to his
mind trained in Biblical metaphors.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no fears for our young couple; the New
World moulds its people. The practical life of
which they are an integral part will make their road
clear to them. I have lived long in America. It is
a land of proof, not belief; of practical results and
a kind of idealism which is expressed in action.
There is no time for dreams; inspiration feeds only
on quick realization. A land of no secrets, where
publicity methods are applied alike to business,
science, literature, religion. That which cannot be
exploited is called &#8216;high-brow&#8217;&mdash;but there is a saving
humor in it all. America is a great country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor answered with just a touch of good-natured
satire.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there are no secrets, how is it that the Church
has prospered there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Church adapts itself....</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going back to Rome, with a mind at rest.
We have held together the thread of two lives
which threatened to snap, nay, three lives: there is
a boy whose career must be watched closely. Other
forces are at work&mdash;race impulses; they must be
eradicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that possible?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>&#8220;Yes, but difficult. I shall bring the boy to
Rome; there, all other influences will be neutralized.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor offered his hospitality for the night,
which was gratefully accepted. It had been a turbulent
time ending happily. The priest was in a
frame of mind harmonizing with the beauty of
approaching twilight. They sat outside the ch&acirc;let.
The pastor filled long glasses with the wine of the
Canton, which expands the Soul. They sat there,
looking into the Val Sinestra, until the sun scattered
rubies and the moon threw down a silver veil.</p>

<p>They talked of the future of religion and the
wave of unbelief sweeping over the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I meet a man like you,&#8221; said the priest,
&#8220;I regret the loss to the Church. Protestantism
was at best a frail child; it cannot survive without
support. Why should it not come back? We
would kill the fatted calf to celebrate the return of
our Prodigal Son.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor saved the situation with a fine sense
of humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend, we are not father and son: we are
brothers, prodigal children of the great original
God of the Hebrews.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest&#8217;s eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why not a family reunion? It has been
my life&#8217;s dream&mdash;all sects united in the spacious
bosom of the true Faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor nodded in silent approval. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Luther would come into his own. At this same
moment, far away in the East, the muezzin was
chanting from the minarets, calling the people to
prayer. &#8220;There is but one God, and Mohammed
is his Prophet,&#8221; and at this same time, millions of
humans, prostrate before Buddha, were praying to
attain the perfection of the Soul&mdash;Nirvana; and
the &#8220;chosen people&#8221; once again in Jerusalem were
praising the &#8220;only&#8221; God, who had led them out of
exile into the land of their fathers. The priest and
the pastor would soon solve their problem&mdash;they
were both approaching with silent rapid steps, the
solution of the Great Mystery.</p>

<p>The next morning Father Cabello thanked the
pastor again for his good offices. He was a practical
man, and in the light of day, dreams evaporate.
He did not speak of buying the chapel; he
wanted to go in peace.</p>


<h3>27</h3>

<p>Angela sat at the wheel, her quick skilful fingers
spinning the yellow thread. The girl, with her unerring
instinct of the unseen, felt the air weighing
heavily. The atmosphere of the house was charged
with sadness; unhappy spirits had passed through,
leaving something of their sorrow, their passions.
The anguish of Floyd still lingering in her little
room kept her awake at night. The dead man was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
always before her&mdash;his uneven gait, the passionate
face, the glittering eyes. A great longing went out
from her to that rebellious soul, beating so long
against bars, a prisoner in his own body....</p>

<p>The pastor had gone over to the hotel for
Martin&#8217;s one valise and the little deerskin box. He
spoke to the woman of the house; she remembered
her father telling of a Staehli who went &#8220;across
seas&#8221; and never came back. The crooked gardener,
shuffling about, chimed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I knew Martin Staehli. He had a quarrel
with a guide about a woman, and shot him dead.
He was hot blooded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man lost on the mountain was his grandson,&#8221;
said the pastor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange things happen in a lifetime,&#8221; mumbled
the gardener. &#8220;Now who would believe, to look
at me, that I was once the champion wrestler of the
village!&#8221;...</p>

<p>The next morning at sunrise the pastor knocked
at Angela&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Angela, we are going &#8216;up there&#8217; today.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the summer, when they were pasturing
the cattle, she and the pastor spent many a happy
time with the peasant boys and girls who had gone
up in June, clinging gradually from one plateau to
another until they reached the top, where they
would stay until the weather drove them down.</p>

<p>Angela sprang joyfully out of bed and went to
fetch her basket; on the way up she would look for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
herbs. It was wonderful how she spied the rare
plants hid away under the rocks and at the bottom
of brooks. They went slowly, at first, Angela timing
her steps to the pastor&#8217;s, who grasped his stick,
gaining strength as he climbed. Not far behind, a
guide followed, carrying the belongings of the unfortunate
man. In Switzerland every waterfall,
river, flower, bush, and tree has its legendary Spirit.
Miracle stories come down by word of mouth. The
old grandmother sitting outside the ch&acirc;let at night,
a pipe between her toothless gums, her needle running
a race with her tongue, tells the children of the
wonders of the mountains:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the old days, when a mountaineer had been
lost on the heights, the peasants would go from
peak to peak calling his name. Where the echo
repeated they stopped, and would throw down
articles of clothing and a large cheese from the milk
of the missing man&#8217;s herd, to keep his spirit from
cold and starvation. They tell of a peasant who
was lost. They let down his dog on a rope. The
faithful animal, whining in low dog tones, eagerly
scented the way. When they drew up the rope it
was bitten through. The dog had found the body
of his master and would not leave him. Whenever
there is a thick mist the peasant is seen, his dog
beside him, on the edge of the chasm, pointing with
a warning finger to the precipice.&#8221;...</p>

<p>The merry band of dairy workers welcomed the
pastor with shrill cries and clarion notes from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Alpine horns. It was a modest community; each
one owned his little herd. There were many huts,
where the milk is set in earthen bowls, yielding
cream, butter, cheese, their only wealth. The pastor
drew a herdsman aside and spoke to him in low
tones. A stillness fell on the merry band. The
man led them across the field to a deep pool fed by
mountain torrents; at a narrow end was a rough
rustic bridge, which they crossed in single file, and
came into a thick pine grove. Farther on, the clearing
was carpeted with roses, anemones, violets.
They walked carefully, not to crush them; then they
climbed up a steep rock to a cow-hut on the top.</p>

<p>Angela gave a low cry. A man lay on a bed of
hay, his arm in a rough splinter, his face the wax of
death. She dropped down beside him, listened to
his heart, tried to raise his closed lids.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; answered the peasant. &#8220;I have
seen many such cases of suspended animation, from
the shock of a heavy fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he told them how Martin had been saved
from going to the bottom of the precipice by being
caught in a crevice of the rocks. He was found
tightly wedged in, covered by the stones that had
rolled down. The dog had scented the place where
he lay. It would be a miracle if he lived.</p>

<p>The pastor patted the head of the animal, who
would now and again put his paw very gently on the
man&#8217;s chest, as if seeking for heart-beats. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
he&#8217;d lick the white face, wag his tail, and stretch
himself out again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t give up hope,&#8221; said the pastor, &#8220;until
the dog howls and slinks away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angela was moving about. She made a wood
fire on the rock outside, filled a large iron pot with
water, and stirred in her herbs with which she
would bathe his bruised body. They emitted a
pungent, agreeable perfume. The pastor watched
her as she stood, a bright figure against the dark
pine background: &#8220;a blessed child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angela passed the night in a hut with the dairy
maids. She was intensely awake, concentrating her
entire spiritual power. She ceased to be a human
thing; she became a Thought, a disembodied Will.
She arose from the bed where the peasant girls
were sleeping, three together, their arms entwined,
their hair sweeping the ground, their white arms
and bosoms like ivory in the night light&mdash;a great
picture of future mothers, bearing in their bodies
the next generation. She stepped out into the air,
listened to the walking of the waters, the talking
of the trees; she heard panting. Something warm
pressed against her. The dog jumped on her,
whining. What was the message? Was it death?
She followed the excited animal over the stones,
over the pool, into the hut. The man was lying as
she had left him, but there was something in his
face that made her heart leap. She took the limp
form in her arms. The breath of her young body,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the life that was in the sap of the trees, the minerals
of the springs, the healing balsam of the air, all the
natural force in her, and more, the dynamic power
of the spirit, went out to him. Her hands, tingling
with electricity, moved tensely over his chest, his
limbs; the dog watched, helping with his mute soul.
Suddenly the curtains over the heavy eyes quivered,
opened, then dropped again; her fingers on his pulse
felt slow intermittent throbs. She had dragged him
from the depths&mdash;he hovered for weeks between
Life and the Beyond, coming back slowly, but the
mind remained inert. The summer was unusually
mild; they put him outside on a soft bed of boughs,
where he lay day and night in silence with the dog
beside him, his eyes following Angela as she moved
about. She taught him to walk again, guiding his
steps carefully.</p>

<p>The pastor came weekly to see him, spoke to
him, but he didn&#8217;t answer. Angela grew anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe not,&#8221; said the pastor. &#8220;It is a kind of
aphasia, which time will cure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angela wondered if he could distinguish sounds&mdash;the
chirping of the birds, the bark of the
dog, the music of the herd. The peasants would
tell in lowered voices of a shadow of a man standing
under the pines, so still, the chamois would come
closer, closer, looking at him with their soft, beseeching
eyes; then they&#8217;d scamper away....</p>

<p>August!&mdash;It was bleak. The man sat on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
trunk of a tree; he was without the thrill of life.</p>

<p>The pastor spoke to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>A flash passed over the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor&#8217;s voice grew stern.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will go down tomorrow with the herdsmen.
You are the peasant Staehli: they are your people;
you are one of them. You have been all your
life in exile; now you are on your natural soil. The
voice of race will awaken in you&mdash;you will find
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man listened, agonized with the intensity of
concentration; the words cut like sharp stones into
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand, you are the peasant Staehli.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer came back mechanically:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the peasant Staehli.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day, Staehli the peasant went down
with the herds from plateau to plateau, lingering
while the weather favored. Late in the summer
they reached the valley.</p>


<h3>28</h3>

<p>Winter in that little hidden-away corner of the
world, snow without beginning, without end,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
scarcity of food, dread of the avalanche. The
peasant is a fatalist, accepting the inevitable with
silence, with awe. &#8220;God is good; He sends summer
as a rich reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor shared the hard lot of his parish.
The Devil was always there in the shape of
&#8220;schnaaps,&#8221; driving the simple souls to madness,
making cretins of their children. The pastor
fought the &#8220;Evil One&#8221; with holy ire like his great
ancestor Martin Luther. Every night he would
take his lantern and tramp over to the Inn, sit with
&#8220;his children,&#8221; drink with them moderately, see the
liquor locked up, put the key in his pocket, and go
his way. Many a morning he found the cupboard
tampered with, pretending not to see the lock had
been repaired. Now Martin went with him, sitting
silent, answering laconically.</p>

<p>The pastor gave him much physical labor&mdash;washed
out roads to remake, wood to cut and draw.
There was a landslide; a part of the village was
under snow. Martin worked with pick and shovel
to dig out the people, carrying the women and
children in his arms, his strength growing as the
hardiest collapsed. When it was too cold for the
old man, Martin went alone to the Inn to lock up.</p>

<p>One night, walking home, the sky like velvet
studded with clustered diamonds, the mysterious
blue light on the snow, the silence, the penetrating
beauty, threw a spell over him. He wandered till
the unseen sun shot up faint rays, turning the white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
world into faded rose; then memory stirred in him.
Angela saw him tracing with a piece of charcoal on
a board. She put slips of paper and pencil in his
way; he scribbled on them, threw them down, forgot
them. They were confused lines crossing,
recrossing, impressionist shapes of mountains, and
always the faint outlines of a woman&#8217;s head. She
put them carefully in a box he would remember
some day. She saw quick flashes in his eyes, sparks
blazing up, dying out.</p>

<p>He sat outside the ch&acirc;let, hammering nails into
the soles of the mountain boots he had made for
himself. The Staehlis had always learnt a trade&mdash;they
were shoemakers, tanners, blacksmiths, herders,
sons of toil and of the soil. The pastor stood
watching him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The snow has melted in the valley, the sky is
clear. We will wander forth&mdash;to the south first,
and back on foot when the trees blossom.&#8221;</p>

<p>They started off in the early morning. An old
peasant, leaning somewhat heavily on his solid staff
of hickory wood, a young peasant, silent, unsmiling.
Angela put paper and crayon in his knapsack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me pictures; they tell more than words.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They tramped through valleys, over hills, jumping
on hay-wagons, climbing into stage-coaches,
riding the sure-footed mountain pony. The pastor
watched Martin. There were blood streaks in his
eyes; his face was like a wax mask.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>They came to lovely Lugano, the Fatima in
Switzerland&#8217;s harem of beauties, warm, passionate&mdash;the
soft Italian patois, Italian air, Italian skies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over there across the lake is Milan, Rome, the
Raphael frescoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s eyes gleamed; then he shook his head.
The pastor sighed&mdash;would he ever wake up?</p>

<p>Geneva&mdash;intellectual, proud of its men of genius.
They walked through Rousseau&#8217;s Island of Exile.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was greatly gifted,&#8221; said the pastor, &#8220;but
the victim of his own sensuality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all that,&#8221; said Martin. Then the veil
of melancholy dropped again.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we are conscious of it, the cure is there.
Rousseau was the mind of his generation; he might
have been its soul, but he never found himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Einsiedeln&mdash;with its monasteries a thousand
years old, its few sad Benedictine hermits poring
over their ancient manuscripts, restoring the eaten-away
remnants, kept with pious reverence hidden
in old chests. Einsiedeln&mdash;its pilgrims, its Life
Eternal, hypnotized, under the spell of religion.</p>

<p>Arosa&mdash;the bleak mountains, the hopeless sick
wrapped in blankets on open balconies. Martin
shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zurich again, with its historical surroundings.
The pastor told the story of Charlemagne who,
finding a toad sitting in the nest of a beautiful
serpent, drove it out and killed it with one blow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
his heavy stick. &#8220;There was a banquet at the
Palace that night; the guards were terrified at the
sight of a white spotted snake who crawled into the
hall, wound herself up on the legs of a chair, and
dropped a priceless jewel into the goblet of wine
which the monarch held to his lips, giving him the
magic gift of compelling the love of all who set eyes
on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A toad in her nest,&#8221; repeated Martin....</p>

<p>Two months in the cities, then the country beautiful&mdash;the
trees heavy with white blossoms, bearing
embryonic fruit. Toward evening the air grew
heavy with the day&#8217;s perfume; the night was warm
in the valley. Martin moved about restlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot sleep; let us go into the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked through dark trails, lit faintly by
stars shining through the trees; then he broke a
long silence, speaking of himself for the first time,
slowly, timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The air goes through me; it is sweeping away
that terrible fear. If I could be free of the horror
that tears at me, the horror of&mdash;madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pastor spoke eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fight it, Martin, drive it out. It is an illusion,
an evil thought that does not exist. Martin, your
soul is in prison, beating its wings against the bars
of your own obstinacy; let it soar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot. I am choked with wild impulses,
driving me to distraction. I am mad! I tell you,
mad!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>&#8220;Martin! there is a madness which destroys, and
a madness that reveals; such madness has been the
salvation of the world. Come, sit down with me,
here in this forest, where once lived and suffered
our great ancestor, our patron Saint, Mad Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad Martin?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he told in picturesque English, lapsing
unconsciously into his own musical Romansch, the
legend of Mad Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was one of a lawless band, the youngest
bandit of them all&mdash;a beautiful youth with the
grace of a wild stag, without fear or sense of right,
prowling about with his carbine, robbing, killing,
consorting with lewd women. One night, a night
like this in the woods where holiness dwelt, something
stirred within him&mdash;a voice clear, beautiful,
said wonderful things which gave his soul wings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! that happens sometimes, a voice from
within,&#8221; said Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He left the band, made his way to the church
and begged to be taken in. He was rarely gifted;
the monks saw in him the white fervor of the saint.
The Lord had changed the murderous rage of the
robber into the divine madness of the fanatic. He
went to Einsiedeln and there, it was said, heard the
voice of God, who commanded him to become a
monk. As the story goes, the Lord, to try his
piety, put in his way a last temptation. He was
walking in the woods, reading his prayers, when he
suddenly came upon a beautiful vicious thing who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
had loved him in his bandit days; she put her arms
around him, her mouth to his. He forgot Heaven.
He tried to tear himself away. Her kisses held
him. She lured him to her cabin and in the intoxication
of passion, he took no count of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her kisses held him,&#8221; repeated Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;She made a plan that would bind him to her
forever; she plied him with wine until his senses
fled, stripped him naked, crowned him with a
wreath of red poppies, left him dancing and singing
ribald songs, a young Bacchus in the woods; then
she called the priests to witness his degradation.
They believed her not; the young Divine was deep
in the under cells, fasting, praying, purifying his
body, preparing for his ordination. She mocked
at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fools! He is no priest, he is Mad Martin.
He cannot change; his blood still riots in him, calling
for wine, for women. If I lie, burn me at the
stake!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad Martin in the woods heard the angry
voices of the people, the mocking gibes of the
woman, and realized his degradation. He fled to
the cabin, locked himself in, fell on his knees, and
prayed for help. The chanting of priests, the cries
of the people grew louder&mdash;their axes were breaking
down the door. The poor sinner raised his
arms to Heaven, with a cry, in which his battered,
stricken soul took joyful flight. When the enraged
people burst into the cabin, they found it empty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
They searched the cells of the monastery; there was
no trace of him. The Father Superior, a holy man
of years, was calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wait, he will not fail us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The day of consecration came; among the
young priests stood a tall figure in white, ready to
take his vows. He was pale and faint from fasting,
but his voice was like a bell sounding from the distance.
As he left the altar there was a bright light
on his face. The people followed him on their
knees. He put out his hands, blessed them, and the
cripples threw away their crutches and the sick were
well. Then he blessed Einsiedeln and made it a
holy place for pilgrims in the ages to come. He
blessed the village under the mountain, where he
was born, sinned, and atoned, and prophesied its
future peace, prosperity. Then he disappeared before
their eyes, but he has been kept alive in our
hearts and memory. Every three years, the people
of our village give in the little chapel &#8216;The Miracle
of Saint Martin.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Martin sat, his face
buried in his hands. The pastor spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin! Free yourself of this horror; let
Hope in. Life is knocking at your door with gifts
of fulfillment!&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin struggled with the torrent of feeling
rushing through him; then the dry eyes grew moist,
the tears came. The fever of hate, the passion of
Love, the terrible impulse of self destruction, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
devil tempting in the night, the thought of life with
reason gone&mdash;all the dangers of an overwrought
mind were washed away in those tears. He
dropped down, broken, helpless, on the new sweet
hay in a little hut near by; the cool air swept over
him. A bird&#8217;s plaintive call startled the silence&mdash;an
unforgettable night of spiritual revelation,
Peace....</p>

<p>It was dawn when he awoke. He looked about
for the Pastor, found him lying in a corner, his
mantle wrapped about him. Martin looked long at
the noble snow-crowned head, then stole softly out,
came upon a clear pool hidden in the trees&mdash;we
meet them unexpectedly in Switzerland, startling us
with their limpid loveliness.</p>

<p>There was a flash of Glory!&mdash;the Sun! He felt
a sense of elation, of new birth. The sky turned
purple, pink, gold; the color ecstasy crept into his
blood. Color! the life of the world! Color clamored
in his brain for expression, for air; he was
obsessed with the madness that reveals, the divine
madness of the artist.</p>

<p>The pastor stood beside him. The sun was
climbing. Martin pointed to a ball of fire down
deep in the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to bring it up,&#8221; he said. He slipped
off his clothes and dived in, floating, twisting himself
like a dolphin, spouting water in the air; then
he ran along the green borders, his body gleaming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
in the sun. The pastor thought of the legend of
the Water Gods.</p>

<p>They went slowly on foot toward home, stopping
at the little Dorfs, where the peasants greeted them
with acclamations. &#8220;A fine lad! a Staehli, every
inch of him.&#8221; Martin returned their gripping
handshakes, tossed down their schnaaps, gave them
points on the disinfection of barns and the care of
cows, danced with the maids on the green, kissed
them; they pelted him with flowers.</p>

<p>At the door of the ch&acirc;let, Angela stood waiting.
He put a portfolio in her hands, bits of color he had
caught on the way. Her eyes were fixed on his face.
This was not the Martin she had known: it was like
the same face reflected in clear water, etherealized
by the refraction of light. She heard him in the
fields, his strong voice filling the distance with
melody. She looked up at the great mountain. An
unfortunate man called Martin Steele lay there,
dead.</p>


<h3>29</h3>

<p>The Garrisons came back to their home on Park
Avenue. With Mary&#8217;s help and his own will,
Floyd learnt to diagnose Julie&#8217;s actions as &#8220;psychic
impulses.&#8221; She herself couldn&#8217;t do wrong; she
fought against a &#8220;subconscious tendency.&#8221; From
her girlhood it had always been &#8220;like that&#8221;; this
was the bridge over which he could pass to reconciliation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
He had every reason to be satisfied with
his wife. She was in correspondence with Father
Cabello, whose influence revealed itself in her piety.
She became very devout, Heavenly love drove out
the earthly in her. She attended daily mass; the
big-eyed woman with her beautiful boy were well-known
at the Cathedral. Floyd noticed after coming
home from service a rapt expression on her
face; she went about with upturned eyes like St.
Cecilia. He had a vision of a black-robed nun.
He spoke to Dr. McClaren.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid my wife is developing a religious
complex.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; answered the doctor. &#8220;I imagine
before it gets so far, that insatiable emotional
craving of hers will find a new stimulus.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something wrong with Floyd. His
intense desire to forget the &#8220;unpleasant&#8221; episode in
Switzerland had overstrained his nerves. They
reacted in a strange manner. He&#8217;d leave his home
in the morning with the intention of going to see
the Colonel, and would find himself wandering aimlessly
in quite a different direction. He&#8217;d walk for
hours through parts of the city unknown to him;
he saw strange faces, strange places, another world.
He lounged about where the ships came in. The
immigrants had an irresistible fascination. He
watched them, listened to their unintelligible jargon.
A dark-eyed Madonna with a shawl on her
head, a child at her breast, was not strange to him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
He knew her: she was Julie&#8217;s sister. A bearded old
man, carrying on his bent shoulders the tragedy of
his race, looked at him with the eyes of Joseph
Abravanel. A straight tall peasant with bundles,
bewildered by the city, was Martin&#8217;s grandfather.
It was a kind of mental phantasmagoria of those
who had worked a sinister influence in his life. He
couldn&#8217;t get rid of them; he saw their Past, their
Present, their Future, the struggles, the agony, the
hopelessness. He was flung backward, forward
with them. Must he go on living with them all his
life? A horror seized him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taxi, sir, take you anywhere&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A tall chauffeur with dark goggles took him by
the arm and lifted him into the cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd bent forward, he knew that voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom Dillon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Garrison. You won&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd grasped his hand with quick sympathy and
drew him into the car. Tom choked at first, but
gradually recovering himself, told his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;I married Maudy, because I couldn&#8217;t get her
any other way. Oh, she was a kisser. She&#8217;d go
as far as the fence, but she wouldn&#8217;t jump it. We
were coming home from a dance up the road. I
tried it on. &#8216;Tom,&#8217; she said, &#8216;if you want me, you&#8217;ll
have to marry me.&#8217; I married her. I didn&#8217;t take
it seriously. I thought this way: It&#8217;s as broad as
it&#8217;s long. When I get enough, there&#8217;s Reno. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
flung the dough like Hell; I couldn&#8217;t see any value
for it, only a heap of rags. Anyhow, a man can
get liquor and women&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom shifted uneasily in his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you don&#8217;t earn, money melts. My credit
kept me going for a time. Then I had to tell her.
I was sure she&#8217;d leave me. I&#8217;m only good to hand
out. She told me that lots of times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She left you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s eyes snapped; he was radiant with pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t. She had an auction sale. All her
friends were there; they wouldn&#8217;t miss it. She sold
everything, even her engagement ring, and paid
every cent I owed. By God! she did.&#8221; There was
a choked sob. &#8220;I had to do something to get even,
didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Tom.&#8221; Floyd was beginning to respect
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to my friends, but they wanted solid men
in their business, and I couldn&#8217;t blame &#8217;em. I
walked about like a crazy man, couldn&#8217;t get a job.
She kept enough to furnish a band-box in the
Bronx. She does all the work. You must see her.
She&#8217;s as pretty as a peach, and the place is as neat
as wax.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you come to this, Tom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She sent me to sell the car; that hurt me. I
went and sat around the garage with the boys. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
was down and out; they had money to burn. They
said, &#8216;Sell? nothing doing&mdash;a car like yours is
capital.&#8217; Well, I didn&#8217;t sell; I commenced going
out nights. I was ashamed to be seen, but I got
over that. Then I risked it in the daytime; now I
flaunt my shame. I tell you! it&#8217;s a rotten world&mdash;when
I had money it was a stunt to do my own
repairs. When I took the crowd out joy riding, I
was a good sport, but to &#8216;hack&#8217; for a living is common.
I&#8217;m done with that swell bunch. Maudy says
they&#8217;re beneath us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he sat looking at Floyd, his eyes begging.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, you&#8217;ve solved your problem, I&#8217;m proud
of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom heaved a sigh of relief and got back to
business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I suppose you want to get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Floyd, wearily.</p>

<p>Tom gave him a sharp look.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing down here anyhow, seeing
some capitalist off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, watching poor wretches come in. I&#8217;ve been
through a lot, and I haven&#8217;t quite got my bearings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom asked no questions, but he told Maudy
afterwards he was sure Garrison &#8220;had some
trouble with that crazy wife of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come outside with me and get
some fresh air&mdash;you don&#8217;t mind me taking a fare
if it comes my way. I&#8217;ve got another car; there&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
a guy in with me. I dope it out this way: he gets
twenty-five per cent of the takings, I get the rest and
pay for the damn gas. The car&#8217;s on instalment;
when we pay it off we&#8217;ll go it equal. Fair enough,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom had coarsened; the veneer of wealth was
gone. Floyd liked him that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve grown stouter, Tom; you&#8217;re the picture
of health.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom, slapping his chest complacently, came in
collision with an enormous truck. He let out a
stream of oaths, which paralyzed the physically inferior
opponent. The poor devil cranked frantically
and got out of his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was your fault, Tom, not his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it was, but that alien wouldn&#8217;t dare
open his mouth to a free-born American. If he
tried it on, they&#8217;d wipe him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom spoke with a rich Irish inherited brogue,
which all his college education hadn&#8217;t eradicated.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were talking about me, weren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gained thirty pounds, I eat like a hog, and
I&#8217;m for Prohibition every time. At first I worried
myself to bones about Maudy. I was afraid to tell
her I was hacking. Her family&#8217;s a hundred per
cent American and she&#8217;s damn proud. When I
brought home money she wouldn&#8217;t take it&mdash;&#8216;You&#8217;re
on the crook, Tom, and I&#8217;m going to leave you.&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
Then I blurted it all out. I was frightened stiff&mdash;what
do you think she did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t any idea, Tom&mdash;abused you roundly
for a piker?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na&mdash;she just hugged me till I didn&#8217;t have a
breath left. &#8216;Tom,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve cried many a
long night. I couldn&#8217;t see <i>you</i> making a living.
God is good; He wouldn&#8217;t let me go begging to my
rich friends. Hacking&#8217;s a fine business, but there&#8217;s
something against it&mdash;those flappers. Don&#8217;t take
&#8217;em in your car; sooner lose a fare. You&#8217;re good
looking and they&#8217;ll get you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd laughed. Tom was the right medicine for
him.</p>

<p>They were driving uptown&mdash;Tom&#8217;s tongue went
faster than the car; he had acquired a lot of practical
information. &#8220;They&#8217;re starring the crime
wave now, all bunk&mdash;we&#8217;re no worse than we were.
Wait till after the election, the prisons will be so
empty they&#8217;ll have to turn &#8217;em into meeting houses.
What do you think of them stinking Republicans
up in Washington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, don&#8217;t insult my inherited political party.
I&#8217;ve had them handed down to me, and I must carry
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom opened his mouth, the brimstone flowed, the
air was blue; then suddenly he was dazzled by two
shapely legs encased in flesh-colored cobwebs, and
a pair of bright eyes emitting sparks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taxi, Miss?&#8221; He drew up to the curbstone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
smiling at her, showing his white teeth, sprang out,
opened the door, dusted off the seat, held the rug
in his hand.</p>

<p>She was undecided. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go,
yet....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes you do, but you don&#8217;t know it,&#8221; laughed
Tom.</p>

<p>A gust of cold wind blew her against him. Tom
glanced downward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your legs are cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Warm as toast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your blood keeps them warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>She twisted her little mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my vanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clever girl. Tom lifted her bodily into the car;
they were old friends now. He wrapped her in the
warm rug and put a match to her cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the melancholy Dane in front?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! He&#8217;s a guy I&#8217;m breaking in.&#8221;</p>

<p>They drove to Madison Avenue. She jumped
out and gave him a generous fare.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go out again tonight; call for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled into the pretty laughing eyes. &#8220;Awful
sorry, Miss, but there&#8217;s nothing doing. I&#8217;m married.&#8221;
He heaved a big sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was nice&mdash;wasn&#8217;t she.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd slapped him on the back. &#8220;You&#8217;re a hero,
Tom. It was a great temptation.&#8221; Tom beamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken it into their pretty heads to star
the chauffeur. We&#8217;re the cowboys of the East.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
We drive and slash about, and lasso them in. Say,
I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to lose my man&mdash;handsome
lad, good family. There&#8217;s a little snipe baiting for
him, and she&#8217;ll hook him too.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the garage he found a note.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Married this morning to Ida, family approve.</p></div>

<p>Tom&#8217;s sorrow was pathetic. &#8220;They&#8217;re rich brokers.
They&#8217;ll put him on the street. He&#8217;ll never be
able to earn an honest penny again. Where shall I
find another like him? The girls fell for him every
time. He was a handsome fish. You&#8217;ve got nothing
to do; help me out just for today. You can run
a car. It doesn&#8217;t need so much experience, and I
can&#8217;t afford to let her stand idle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got the experience, Tom, but I can
hand you the good looks,&#8221; said Floyd, modestly.</p>

<p>Tom was jubilant; he&#8217;d have to keep his mind on
the wheel&mdash;and a few knocks would shake him up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll give you the fruits of my experience.
Before you turn a corner, blow the horn, then stop
and listen. Don&#8217;t try to pass anything; let the other
fellow smash you up&mdash;then you&#8217;ll get damages.
The wise guy says, &#8216;we&#8217;ve got a third eye in the
back of our heads.&#8217; Exercise yours; it&#8217;ll work after
a while. When an old woman or a cat gets in
front, don&#8217;t run her down, jump off and put her on
the sidewalk. Train your ears to hear the pistol in
a man&#8217;s pocket. Keep your foot on the brake and
a curb on your temper; a timely joke can make it a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
dollar more. You&#8217;ll get into tough places, so does
a doctor. Your fare is your patient; save his life
if you can. When it comes to a toss up, you know
who gets the preference. Never argue with a
crook; take whatever he gives. If it&#8217;s nothing, say
thank you and get away. Don&#8217;t let pretty feet lead
you astray. A man&#8217;s strength depends on his disposition,
and the time of night. If you fall for it,
forget it. Do what you can&#8217;t help, but&mdash;whatever
you do, don&#8217;t get found out. It&#8217;s all contradiction;
you do something now and you don&#8217;t do it the next
time. If the same thing happens twice, it&#8217;s never
the same thing. You&#8217;ve got to be not only a good
chauffeur but a good actor, a good talker, a good
curser, a good fighter, a good navigator, a good all-around
regular feller, and then you don&#8217;t half fill
the bill. Now scoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; said Floyd, and plunged into the
depths of the night city.</p>

<p>His first venture in the taxi business was a personal
success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taxi, sir, taxi, Miss, take you anywhere&mdash;where
to, Miss?&#8221; The women jumped in at once; he
picked up two, going to the theatre. Would he call
for them at eleven-thirty?</p>

<p>&#8220;With great pleasure,&#8221; answered Floyd. He
helped them out, and stood with his hat in his hand.
He forgot he was a chauffeur for a moment. Then
he drove people uptown, downtown, all over town,
guiding his car in and out of the great mass of congested
traffic.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>A young fellow rushed at him. &#8220;Drive for your
life, my wife is dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was up in the Bronx. Floyd put on the speed.
He got away from two policemen and landed at a
brick house with the blinds lowered. The man
dashed up the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she alive? Thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw Floyd a bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did well, my man, keep the change.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd felt like a public benefactor. Hacking was
a noble profession.</p>

<p>He was hailed by two men who jumped in. He
didn&#8217;t like them. He heard the pistol; looked into
the butt of it. They gave him a street number outside
the city limits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive like Hell!&#8221; He did. The men jumped
out into a vacant lot. &#8220;Now cut away, and don&#8217;t
squeal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd said &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and shot across the
town. He was held up and questioned. No, he
hadn&#8217;t seen anybody. He had no compunctions.
He wouldn&#8217;t give the guys away; that wasn&#8217;t sport.
Then he took the car back to the garage, and went
home in the subway. He had thirty dollars. He
put fifteen in an envelope, addressed it to Tom, and
wrote on a slip of paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Tom: Here is half the boodle. It was a great experience.
Ready to help out at any time.</p></div>

<p>Tom got back early to the garage, washed his
khaki suit, hung it up to dry, cleaned his car, looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
over the motor. He waited for Floyd, but he didn&#8217;t
show up; he was sure the car would come back
damaged. He expected that, but he hoped Garrison
wouldn&#8217;t get hurt. Then he grew impatient. It
didn&#8217;t matter to &#8216;<i>that guy</i>&#8217; how long he stayed out&mdash;<i>his</i>
wife wasn&#8217;t waiting for him. He said good
night to the man in the garage, told him to look out
for a &#8216;green-hand,&#8217; and showed him where the
bandages were. Then for a bit of exercise he
walked up to the Bronx, taking a drink now and
then to ease his mind. It was two o&#8217;clock when he
opened the door of the little flat. The kitchen was
spotless, the blue and white oilcloth shone like
marble tiles. There was a tray on the table, with
cold corned beef and three large baked potatoes;
the coffee was gurgling on the gas stove. He devoured
everything in sight, washed up the dishes,
then went into the next room and stood at the bed.
Maudy was in a deep sleep, how pretty she was.
She must have been very tired or she would have
heard him come in. She&#8217;d been scrubbing that
damn kitchen floor again. She couldn&#8217;t wait till
Sunday morning; that was his job. He looked at
her small hands. They were rough from the washing
soda, and the nails were not manicured. He
had to kiss them, he couldn&#8217;t help it. She opened
her eyes, smelt the hootch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, you&#8217;re going it; you&#8217;ll break your neck
one night, and I&#8217;ll be a widow&mdash;take a bath.&#8221; The
sleepy eyes closed, she dropped off again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>Tom put a roll of bills under her pillow, slipped
out of his clothes and fell on the sofa. He didn&#8217;t
take a bath, he&#8217;d gotten over that pastime; he had
something better to do.</p>


<h3>30</h3>

<p>Floyd woke up the next morning, his head aching,
his limbs weary. The experience had battered
his body, but shook up his mind. His share of the
&#8220;boodle&#8221; lay on the table&mdash;three five-dollar bills.
He examined them curiously, turning them over
and over&mdash;the first money he had ever earned.
Was it money? No&mdash;he threw away much more
than that paltry sum every day. But this was different;
he had worked for it with the &#8220;sweat of his
brow.&#8221; He felt the pressure of the masses, who
were earning their bread. This meant money to
them. He remembered how the Colonel looked at
him, when he told him to sell something&mdash;they
were needing more and more. &#8220;You&#8217;re destroying
capital,&#8221; said the Colonel. &#8220;You should preserve
it, it&#8217;s your only source of income.&#8221;</p>

<p>Capital! capital! He wondered if they had
blown in all his father had left&mdash;blown in, where?&mdash;into
the air like soap bubbles, which glittered for
a moment in the sun, then burst and disappeared.</p>

<p>He put his hand to his head. Where could he
go to pass the morning? Julie was not visible until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
twelve. She was lucky; the day was only half as
long for her. Then that queer feeling came again;
he went to see Dr. McClaren.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s your wife?&#8221; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, as far as I can see. I want to speak
to you about myself&mdash;my mind wanders&mdash;I cannot
concentrate, nothing interests me; I go back always
to the past; the things I have lived through haunt
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trying too hard to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t. If we wipe out memory, we
throw into the dust heap of oblivion the best part
of our life, experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if that experience is unbearable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can make it bearable. We must work it
the right way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I cannot see how! Father Cabello spoke
about the &#8216;gift of forgetting.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor smiled. &#8220;I am not for such narcotics.
We shouldn&#8217;t go about hypnotizing ourselves. A
man of mind should be able to deal with the complications
of his nature in an intelligent manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>This meant nothing to Floyd; the doctor was
talking &#8220;over his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to make it clearer to you. You have got
yourself tangled up. What you think so terrible
one day will be precious to you in years to come.
How do you stand financially?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m not sure&mdash;badly, I think.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>The doctor knew; he had seen the Colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to try to get rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd had a shock. He looked sharply at the
doctor; there was no glare in his eyes, but he was
fingering a paper cutter&mdash;no, he wasn&#8217;t mad&mdash;but
he was a mind reader. Floyd had been thinking
of money&mdash;in a vague way, wondering that so many
people whose names he had never heard had bobbed
up as millionaires.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pursuit of wealth may be sordid, but if we
succeed, we are compensated by a gratifying sense
of self-confidence, authority, power, not speaking
of the good we can do with our &#8216;ill gotten&#8217; gains.
As for the spiritual side being starved, well, we
don&#8217;t think so; if we concentrate on the world of
the spirit, it will demoralize us in our practical life,
which is our end of it. We must uphold that, for
the sake of bankrupt Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor, I dreamt last night that I was enormously
rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! make it a complex. It will drive more
harmful ideas out of your mind. Come and see
me again. I am curious to know how my prescription&#8217;s
going to work....&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd found the Colonel, erect, well satisfied; he
had no complexes, he wasn&#8217;t married.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I stand?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, out with it; I want the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll have to practice strict economy to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
make up for your enormous expenditure of the last
few years. Do you want to sell your house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Economy? Sell the house? Julie!&mdash;impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nowadays a man can&#8217;t live on interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Economy, bah! We&#8217;ll have to create new capital.&#8221;
The Colonel opened a drawer, took out a
card of the Garrison estate, kept as a physician
does the history of a patient&#8217;s disease; then he
placed a map on the table. It was interlaced with
red lines designating the shrinkage. Floyd looked
over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The entire water-front is crossed off, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the Martin Steele Corporation bought it
for investment. By the way, that was a great thing
young Steele did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He left his entire business to his employees,
equal shares, and the money to keep it going.
Waldbridge told me about it with tears in his eyes,
the other day, at the memorial service they gave
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Memorial service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know? I saw Mrs. Garrison there,
but she was gone before I could get through the
crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie there? She hadn&#8217;t told him. He thought
he knew all her movements.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>&#8220;It was wonderful; I wouldn&#8217;t have missed it for
the world. They are going to screen it. It was a
queer mixed crowd&mdash;artists he had saved from
starvation, musicians he had sent abroad, women he
had started right&mdash;they all got up and told their
stories. It was like a Christian Science service. A
man sang, a barber named Hippolyte, well-known on
Fifth Avenue, a wonderful voice. They say an
opera manager has engaged him. He sang psalms
in Greek and Hebrew, wails in the minor key, just
tore at your entrails. He set them all crying. One
poor cripple made a scene; swore he saw the dead
man&#8217;s spirit. Of course, that hypnotized the others;
they all saw it. There was a tall man in a corner&mdash;the
light struck him for a moment. I tell you, Garrison,
I&#8217;ve got the hide of a rhinoceros, but it made
my flesh creep. Now there are two left of those
river shanties, we&#8217;ll pull them down and build one
big office building&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd didn&#8217;t hear him; he was in the church listening
to the voice of Hippolyte, the cries, the prayers
for Martin&mdash;the philanthropist, the good man.
He forced himself to say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew Martin Steele all my life, but had no idea
of that side of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I, but most men keep the best part of them
hidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Floyd, tracing lines on the map. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go down with you and look at those shanties. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
want money and lots of it; every fool&#8217;s got it. I can
be as big a fool as the next one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel didn&#8217;t contradict him, but he doubted
if Garrison would ever be that kind of a fool.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IT took some years to become a &#8220;rich fool,&#8221; but
Garrison accomplished it. He had no business
ability, at least that is what he told people, and honestly
believed it; how could he? he had never been
in business. He thought it well over, and became
what he had always condemned in others&mdash;a gambler.
He risked every dollar he had, and all he
could borrow in hazardous real estate speculations.
It was touch and go many times, as the values rose
and fell. They called him &#8220;Lucky Garrison&#8221;; he
knew better, but there was a grim satisfaction in
his success. He realized as he had learnt to manipulate
money that a man can attain nothing without
it. Other &#8220;big&#8221; interests developed. Every bit of
his energy came into play; there was always some
interesting thing coming up, which led to great connections,
such as international finance and the like.
New &#8220;deals&#8221; got to be a necessary physical tonic,
like a cocktail before dinner, and a strong cigar and
black coffee after....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He scanned the morning paper at the breakfast
table, looking carefully over the financial news and
rate of exchange.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>&#8220;We are sailing into prosperous times,&#8221; said he
to Julie. He was an optimist, like all good American
millionaires. Julie had no opinion, she smiled.</p>

<p>As Dr. McClaren predicted, her religious mania
passed off&mdash;she was now deeply interested in Art, a
patroness of the Museum, and much sought after
by budding talent. Floyd encouraged this &#8220;mania&#8221;;
it was harmless. There was a busy day before him,
a big deal to close; he was in a hurry to get to his
office. She went with him to the door. He looked
up at the imposing staircase and beautiful Tiffany
glass window. He hated it once; how could he have
been so prejudiced? It was all in the very best of
taste, Julie was perfectly framed in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll meet you at the Museum about five o&#8217;clock;
we&#8217;ll drive around for an hour. I forgot to tell
you, I&#8217;ve invited some men to dinner; it&#8217;s business.
Do you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie smiled again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a sudden impulse he took her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you happy, Julie?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him; what made him ask that?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes!&mdash;I have every reason to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything I can buy for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood watching him drive off and waved her
hand. It was well-known in their circle that the
Garrisons were a very devoted couple.</p>

<p>Floyd leaned back in the car, puffing at a cigar.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
The years had changed him; the sensitive boy had
become a man of affairs, a Capitalist. He was very
sane; his Puritan instincts rebelled against the rioting
emotions of the Latins. His life was made up
of facts and figures; ultimately he would have become
an image of clay, like his father&#8217;s statues, but
there was a secret element of his life, of which no
one had the slightest clue. The Past had ceased to
torture him; it became a consolation. He lived over
and over again the Romance of his youth, the agony,
the passion, his first years with Julie, the rage of the
murderer, the whole tragedy, but it didn&#8217;t hurt him
now; Martin was dead, forgiven. We count the
years we have lived to know how old we are&mdash;correct
mathematics, but our age corresponds to other
numbers. Heart swings are the rhythm of our seasons,
recording in spiritual time, the real life.</p>

<p>The car stopped in Twelfth Street. Floyd
jumped out, stood for a moment looking up at the
imposing twenty-story office building which he had
erected on the site of his old home. It had rented
well. There was not a room empty. He had retained
an office for himself on the third floor. He
sat down to his desk, read his mail. He was about
to sell the building&mdash;the psychological moment had
come to &#8220;turn it over&#8221; and get a handsome profit.
He never kept any real estate very long. New York
neighborhoods change and values fluctuate. Then
it occurred to him quite suddenly that the room in
which he sat was about the height of his father&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
workshop in the little house where he was born.
There was no emotion, but it was strange he had
never thought of it before. He looked at the heavy
safe, the walls lined with repositories, where contracts
were kept&mdash;and saw&mdash;clay images. He
looked down at his desk; it was littered with old
rags, bits of arms, legs&mdash;a young man, with an
agonized face, dropped a candle.</p>

<p>He smiled. What courage youth has! It was
well done. The home of his childhood was still his;
he had not desecrated it. He saw Mary flying past
him up the stairs; she had become a world figure,
the head of an international organization of nurses.
When Julie&#8217;s &#8220;headaches&#8221; came on, Mary was always
there. He&#8217;d go softly to the door and wait;
he didn&#8217;t knock; he knew she&#8217;d come out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Garrison is much better; I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll be
all right in the morning.&#8221; Then the worn face, dim
eyes, streaked hair would vanish. She stood again
at the window in her bare room, where they had
loved each other for a moment.</p>

<p>The telephone at his elbow startled him. Julie&#8217;s
voice&mdash;would he order some flowers for the dinner
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, and a bunch for you. Anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; her tone became confidential. &#8220;What
wine do you want served?&mdash;are the gentlemen heavy
drinkers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but they&#8217;ll take all you give them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped the receiver, smiling. How eager<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
he used to be to do all those small errands! the
night of their house-warming&mdash;he drank too much.
That Swede was a nice man. The den on the top
floor was hung now with maps of suburban towns,
new fields for speculation; he spent many evenings
poring over them. Somehow his business mind always
worked well up there in that room where a
man was murdered by his wife.</p>

<p>The stenographer put a paper before him. He
started, came back to reality; it was a bill of sale
and very satisfactory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll close the deal tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he commenced searching in an old desk for
some papers he wanted, and came across a sealed
envelope; on it was written &#8220;Boodle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boodle? What did it mean? He broke the seal
and took out three five-dollar bills.</p>

<p>Tom Dillon! He had quite forgotten him, but
he had a vague idea that he owned a Taxi Company,
and was strong in local politics.</p>

<p>He put back the fifteen dollars, resealed the envelope,
and wrote on it, &#8220;The foundation of the
Garrison fortune.&#8221; He would give the story to his
publicity man&mdash;how an impoverished son of wealth
started in life by earning fifteen dollars as a chauffeur.
Tom Dillon! was the real thing. What <i>was</i>
the real thing? Had <i>he</i> found it? or was he chasing
phantoms? He had that feeling sometimes, in
his most successful moments; it was a queer sensation,
as if he had caught a thing of vapor that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
melted out of hand and challenged him again from
far off&mdash;and again that shadow race!</p>

<p>He thought often of Tom Dillon after that, and
one election night he saw him in the crowd, with a
fine young fellow, the image of his father; they were
laughing and nudging each other like two boy
friends. Floyd shook off a feeling of loneliness and
got out of their way.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Julie was recovering from an attack which left
her mentally exhausted. She lay back in the sedan,
her deep-rimmed eyes like smouldering coals. She
arrived at the Museum an hour before the time
agreed on with Floyd, wandered through the rooms,
making notes about the hanging and grouping of
new pictures. There was a small canvas in a corner
which she thought was somewhat crowded
in. She asked about it. It had been received very
recently and was not yet catalogued. &#8220;Yes, it was
badly hung.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank down on a divan before the picture&mdash;a
Swiss landscape, with a mountain background sloping
down to a grassy plateau; below, a bank of
mist, through which could be distinguished an old
chapel, with a broken cross on top. In a corner,
hardly visible to the naked eye, she read, &#8220;Val
Sinestra,&#8221; and underneath, two letters, M. S.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>She bent nearer, looking eagerly into the picture.
Was it her imagination! or did she really see a
shadowy outline of a man with a white figure in his
arms? Martin! Martin! with flaming eyes, distorted
face!&mdash;desperate! mad!</p>

<p>&#8220;A charming picture, isn&#8217;t it? like a Corot. It&#8217;s
the first of this artist, he&#8217;s not known in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a member of the committee who spoke.
Then Floyd came up and introduced his business
friends. She smiled, asked them if they had seen
some gems in the next room, and led them away
from that picture in the corner.</p>

<p>On arriving home she went through the house
looking for something and finally found it, hidden
away on a top shelf covered with dust; it was a
small glass vase with a delicate stem. The engraving
was beautiful like a white mist over it. The
butler washed it and held it up to the light; colors
flashed through it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bohemian glass, Madame. It will break
easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! It&#8217;s very strong, I&#8217;ve had it a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put it on her bed-table, with a dark red rose
in it. From that time the &#8220;headaches&#8221; were less
frequent, the ravings about punishment ceased.
Mary said to the doctor:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;s getting over those horrible nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; said the doctor wearily. He
himself was suffering from an attack of nerves. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
was getting old, and the hives of human bees he
cared for didn&#8217;t always contain honey. They stung
him at his patients&#8217; table, at births, at marriages; at
deaths, less so&mdash;that was a release. He fought
them with his Scotch tenacity, but they grew too
much for him. Finally he got rid of them by retiring
from active practice and putting the whole
&#8220;bunch&#8221; without names or dates, into a book on
psychical research, which became celebrated.</p>

<p>Julie devoted much time to her boy&mdash;took him in
her car every morning to St. John&#8217;s College, called
for him in the afternoon, preached religion to him
at home, warned him of the great evils which arise
from lack of it. She had been very negligent in her
youth, and was punished for it. Religion was a
great consolation.</p>

<p>He listened to her with deference. He was extraordinarily
gifted and devoured everything he
could lay his hands on in the way of serious reading.
His father was proud of him, but there was
a growing sense of uneasiness about his religious
studies. He saw little of the boy, who spent his
evenings in his own room, filled with books he
had bought himself in the old book shops. Floyd
couldn&#8217;t understand them. The maps which hung
on the walls of his den were more intelligible.</p>

<p>A distant cousin of Julie&#8217;s came to America ostensibly
on business. The Bank, taken over by the
family, had grown enormously rich under American
management. Mr. Gonzola was highly cultured&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
dark, handsome man with white hands and long
tapering fingers. He was delighted with the boy
and his knowledge of international literature. He
found him reading Renan.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s forbidden, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy answered with a gleam of humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not forbidden, but not taught. I read all they
recommend in school, and all they forget, out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then came a letter from Father Cabello to Julie.
He was very glad to hear that everything continued
to be so satisfactory with her. The wonderful gifts
of her boy interested him; he saw in his genius the
hand of God leading him into the Divine path.
They must decide now about his career.</p>

<p>Julie handed the letter to Floyd, who read it
carefully and understood its hidden significance.</p>

<p>&#8220;This means the priesthood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Julie, &#8220;but don&#8217;t speak of that to
Joseph.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening at dinner, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Joseph, would you like to go to Rome to visit
Father Cabello?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s eyes lit up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, it&#8217;s the dream of my life. And&mdash;I
would like to go to Vienna, to see your people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gonzola spoke quietly, his arm around the
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me take him, Julie. I promise you there
will be no influence. Our family has been split into
different religious camps for generations; those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
have remained true to their faith have made no effort
to bring the others back. We do not proselytize.
The missionary is unknown to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie hesitated, looked at Floyd; it was a great
responsibility. The boy was bending over eagerly
watching his father, who decided quickly, as was
his way in business. His theory was, when a man
weighs the pros and cons of an enterprise, the difficulties
grow so great that he generally ends in not
undertaking it. He would give the boy his chance;
he was old enough now to decide for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go with Mr. Gonzola,&#8221; said Floyd.</p>

<p>The boy flung his arms around his father; &#8220;I will
do what is right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you will, my boy,&#8221; answered Floyd. At
that moment he caught sight of Julie&#8217;s face reflected
in the mirror; it was lit by a quick flash of joy.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>When Father Cabello received a letter from Julie
informing him Joseph had sailed with a Gonzola,
he proceeded at once to counteract any possible
&#8220;baleful&#8221; influence. He communicated with the
Catholic members of the family in Vienna, hinting
that the boy was destined for the church. This
branch of the Gonzolas were devout Catholics, generations
old; they welcomed Joseph affectionately
and brought him as early as possible to Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
There he remained for some time, a member of
Father Cabello&#8217;s household, coming and going at
will. The priest watched, waited; the mind of the
boy was not yet ripe for decision.</p>

<p>Joseph was dazzled with his first glimpse of the
Pagan City&mdash;its remains of Hellenic civilization;
the pomp and splendor of its churches; the Cardinals
in their decaying palaces, clinging to the traditions
of the Past; the art of the great Masters, those
faithful servants of the Church, with their wonderful
portrayal of legendary religion. The unearthly
beauty of their divine types, fired the boy&#8217;s imagination,
stimulated him like rich wine, tasted for the
first time, taken again in long draughts until his
senses reeled. The people fascinated him with their
magnetism, their emotional sensuality, their worship
of women, symbolized in the Blessed Virgin and
Child; their passions&mdash;jealousy, hate, revenge, repentance.
He roamed day after day through the
streets, sat for hours in the churches listening to the
chanting of the priests, with a pleasant sense of
drowsiness, like the after effects of a narcotic. He
followed the processions of monks, pilgrims, peasants,
into churches, away from churches, sprinkling
with holy water, kissing burnt pieces of sacred
wood&mdash;and always that music! Oh! that music!
swelling in waves of overpowering sadness from
the throats of unsexed men&mdash;the terrible sweetness
of it, sucking him down into the waters of oblivion,
of self-deception; the soul in safety, interceded for,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
the load of personal responsibility fallen away, care-free
on earth, secure of Heaven, an unutterable
sense of rest from that torturing brain which keeps
persecuting with its unceasing cry, &#8220;Think while &#8217;tis
day, for the night cometh when no man can think.&#8221;</p>

<p>In moments of realization, he would say to the
priest, &#8220;Father, I am going to Vienna; I must go.&#8221;
The priest did not keep him back. The boy must
live through the inevitable experience of intoxication,
reaction, submission. He was travelling
smoothly; he would arrive safely.</p>

<p>When Joseph went from Rome to Vienna to visit
the Gonzolas, he was in a state of mental unrest and
indecision. The artist in him shrank from activity.
He was very sensitive; he couldn&#8217;t bear pain, disappointment.
The Church would be a shelter from
the materialism of the world. It would be ideal to
work for the poor. The garb of piety appealed to
his imagination&mdash;a priest walking among the
wretched, the persecuted, the unhappy, giving everything,
his material wealth, himself, living a simple
contemplative life. The beauty of it all still remained
with him, keeping him in a semi-intoxicated
emotional state. He thought of the works of immortal
art created in the quiet of the cloister.
He was sorely tempted, not by the flesh like St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
Anthony, but by the spirit and the longing for release
from a leaden sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;If not that, what?&#8221; He saw nothing for him
in the future. His father had at least the satisfaction
of success. He himself had created his capital.
It was a game, like racing, roulette, politics&mdash;a
game, life a game! what else? what else?&mdash;It was
all so ugly; the yearning for beauty came again, he
was sorely tempted....</p>

<p>Mr. Gonzola&#8217;s wife and three daughters were
models of domesticated womanhood. Their home
was very modern, with just enough of the idealism
of religion to give it spiritual charm. The girls
were well educated, practical women, keenly alive
to the responsibility of their wealth, full of enthusiasm
and hope for the future of the world. They
received Joseph with great cordiality, helped him
perfect his German, and were silently sympathetic
toward his unsettled spiritual condition of mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gonzola was one hundred per cent maternal:
she mothered her husband, her daughters,
her friends, her poor, and any stray animal who
instinctively came to her for shelter. Joseph was
her life&#8217;s crowning joy, the realization of a hope
long dead&mdash;a son! She found him too thin, too
pale; poor boy, he had never known the cuisine of
Israel, the finest in the world. No Cordon-bleu
can equal the Jewish mother, who cooks with the
subtlety and cleanliness of religious tradition and
puts into her cakes the honey of love. This healthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
sane atmosphere was a good tonic for Joseph&#8217;s over-excited
mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Gonzola&#8217;s ethics were very simple. He kept
the two principles of life wide apart, and gave &#8220;to
God what was His, to men, what was theirs.&#8221; He
was an able man of business, and did not consider
a good bargain with legitimate profit, ungodly.
Sometimes he had an uneasy feeling; the religious
ground was slipping like sand from under his feet.
He said to Joseph with a sigh:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not live up to ritual laws as strictly as I
should. My daughters won&#8217;t let me; but I am going
to take you to Frankfort to visit the head of the
family, Pedro Gonzala, who has preserved the
original spelling of our name and the tradition of
our ancestors. In his home you will see pure orthodoxy,
but&mdash;don&#8217;t forget the responsibility is on my
shoulders. I have given my word to your mother&mdash;and
I want to keep it&mdash;if possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joseph laughed. Mr. Gonzola was an honest
man.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>The family of bankers, with branches all over
the world, were assembled this year in Frankfort.
Pedro Gonzala, despite his great age, was consulted
about every detail by the &#8220;young&#8221; men of the firm,
from fifty years old and upward. The &#8220;children&#8221;
under fifty stood meekly silent, and listened to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
warnings against the ardor of youth and the temptation
of speculative times. The house of Gonzola
had braved many storms, was sometimes drawn into
international financial catastrophes, but it had always
kept its honor unimpeached and continued to
live up to its reputation as creditors of the world.
These cold men of finance led a dual existence.
When they stepped over the thresholds of their palatial
homes, the world outside was forgotten.
They lived their religious life with extreme exactness.
Their wives and daughters were faithful to
the Law, in their domestic life, their marriage life,
and in the education of their children. They were
the remains of a vanishing caste, which lived upon
its own fanaticism.</p>

<p>When Joseph first met Pedro Gonzala in his
private office, he saw a very old man wearing a
black silk skull cap, otherwise well groomed and
modern in appearance. He was seated at his desk,
surrounded by the members of the firm who listened
to him with great respect.</p>

<p>The &#8220;old gentleman&#8221; came to business every day
in his carriage, although he had many cars but was
never known to ride in them. He was interested
in the breeding of horses, frequented the races, and
patronized art, music, and the theatre. Most of
his time was devoted to philanthropic enterprises,
but he kept a firm hand on the ship of finance, of
which he remained until the end of his life the undisputed
head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>He questioned Joseph about his mother, remarking
upon the success of the Gonzola bank in New
York. He knew all about &#8220;lucky Garrison&#8221; who
had shown himself very able. He invited Joseph
to dinner at his home.</p>

<p>The Gonzala mansion was sheltered from the
gaze of the curious, by a closely planted row of
very old trees, whose entwined branches symbolized
the unity of the family, a treasure-house of antiques,
from all parts of the world&mdash;collected with taste
and discernment by each succeeding generation.
The picture gallery was celebrated for its rare masterpieces.
Joseph took great delight in a corner
of family portraits. But the most cherished
treasure of Pedro Gonzala&#8217;s home was Ruth, his
granddaughter, just approaching womanhood; she
was all that was left of his immediate family. The
World War had swept the younger men away. He
had lived ten years longer than the allotted Biblical
time; he was life-worn, but before he went to his
long rest, his little Ruth must be married to a
righteous man, a student of the Talmud, and&mdash;of
<i>equal birth</i>. Such a one was difficult to find.</p>

<p>Pedro Gonzala stood in the grand salon surrounded
by beautiful dark-eyed women and serious
men of finance. He welcomed Joseph in the name
of the family, as a great grandson of that learned
man and deep thinker, Joseph Abravanel, who
fought with all his strength against the wave of assimilation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
which had engulfed his immediate
family.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, my boy, are in the third generation of
those who were led away from the old tradition;
it is not your fault, but no student or thinker can
afford to neglect the study of a race which gave to
the world the first revelation of one God. Hebrew
thought, in its inception, its ethics, its morals, is
the pure wine of religion; in America, they have
thinned it with the water of reform, and put it
into fine-looking bottles with gold labels.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a ripple of applause; the old gentleman
told his little jokes like an actor, expecting response,
which the family gave at the proper time;
then he related the oft-repeated story of his youth,
when his dear Sarah, &#8220;God rest her soul,&#8221; was
alive. He led the boy before a portrait painted by
Rembrandt, representing a stately, handsome matron.
At a ball in Paris, given to them by the
diplomats and aristocrats of France, there were
rumors of war, and much disquietude. He himself
was absent, called away to a serious Cabinet consultation.
The guests crowded about Mrs. Gonzala,
who was gracious and smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not worried, Madame?&#8221; asked a celebrated
diplomat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! No,&#8221; laughed Mrs. Gonzala. &#8220;I am certain
there will be no war, because I will not permit
my husband to lend the money for it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>Ruth stepped daintily down the marble staircase.
Her grandfather had bade her array herself. It
was a gala occasion&mdash;the reunion of the family,
and a welcome to a young Gonzola from America.
Around her neck were rows of costly pearls; diamonds
sparkled in her hair; she wore a cape of
ermine, a young queen of an old dynasty&mdash;an inheritance
of beauty and purity. She put out her
hand to Joseph, and said &#8220;Welcome, cousin Joseph&#8221;&mdash;raising
her face to his. He bent down and
kissed her cheek; they stood looking at each other,
speechless. The women nudged each other. &#8220;What
an ideal couple they might have been&#8221;&mdash;it was a
great pity.</p>

<p>The long dinner table was a beautiful picture
with its service of gold, priceless glass and fine linen,
and the Patriarchal figure at its head. Ruth sat
beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am dazzled,&#8221; said Joseph, &#8220;such lovely
women, such jewels, such wealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not wealthy,&#8221; answered Ruth, &#8220;because
it is a principle of the family to give away a large
part of its income, and you will see that we live very
simply; but tonight all this is in your honor. Our
jewels, furs, laces have come down to us from generations
back; our home and pictures can never be
sold, unless the business goes under, and that will
never happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said Joseph, &#8220;it has meant too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
much to the world; but all these jewels must have
been bought once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, in the times of the Ghetto, when the
Jews were not allowed to own real estate&mdash;so
they bought jewels and hung them around the
necks of their wives who wore them in secret and
gave them to their daughters and daughters&#8217; daughters.
This has an interesting history.&#8221; She
touched a necklace of shining, pink, living things
lying against her white skin. &#8220;When the Romans
separated Queen Berenice from her kingly lover,
the last thing he did was to throw these pearls
around her neck. She went back to her own dominion
and the pearls after her death became the
property of the Temple. We have had them in
our family for many generations.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent down to examine the pearls, but his gaze
stopped at her soft dark eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will give them to your daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ruth, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think I shall ever
marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&#8221; insisted Joseph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; her voice dropped, he bent lower to
listen, &#8220;I can only marry one of my own faith;
they are all dying out. They have forgotten their
ancestry.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>Father Cabello had reached the zenith of his
earthly ambition, the Cardinalate. He had easily
won in the race for advancement&mdash;a man of wealth
and winning personality. The magic word
&#8220;America&#8221; gave him prestige; it was a sign of goodwill
to the church in the United States. The priest
was generally beloved, his doors were always open
to the poor, to whom he gave liberal hands; they
crowded the steps of his house, penetrated into his
apartments. All efforts of his attendants to keep
them away was futile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them in,&#8221; said the Father, &#8220;they will be my
future associates, &#8216;for of such is the Kingdom of
Heaven.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>His secretary, a member of an old patrician
family, shrugged his shoulders; his unspoken
thought was, &#8220;if I have to live with them in Heaven,
I hope I&#8217;ll never die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cardinal had been confined to his room for
some days with an attack of weakness, the result
of an overtaxed heart. The doctor said to him,
&#8220;Your Eminence, you must shun all excitement&mdash;no
more receptions, no more arduous night work,
no activity of any kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cardinal smiled, &#8220;That would be premature
death; I must take my chances. But at present I
cannot work; I have no strength.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>His new honors had not changed his mode of
living. His <i>palazzo</i>, a relic of past grandeur, was
simply furnished with only the necessary chairs and
tables, and completely bare of drapery or superfluous
decorations. The Roman sun flooded his
rooms through the high-arched windows. The
garden of boxwood hedges and old trees was beautiful
and fragrant; he could stand on his terrace
and see the cupolas and innumerable spires of the
city of churches, and listen to the bells pealing&mdash;now
soft, caressing, pleading&mdash;now loud, harsh,
commanding&mdash;those eternal bells that have welcomed
into the world, and followed out of it,
millions of souls.</p>

<p>The Cardinal sat in his private apartment. His
fingers tapped nervously on the polished wood of
the table upon which was a dish of fruits&mdash;figs,
honey, and a silver jug of iced water&mdash;a habit he
had brought from the land of his adoption. He was
waiting for Joseph. In the excitement of his new
honors, weeks had passed with only now and then
the accustomed epistolary greetings, but the time
was approaching to speak of the future. If he
could realize his plan, thought out in every detail,
this boy would inherit his wealth, would carry on
his work among the poor.</p>

<p>A spasm of agony turned his lips blue, his face
livid. He quickly dropped a tablet into a glass of
water and swallowed it. The unbearable pain
slowly subsided; the brain moved again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>&#8220;If God would be merciful and let him live to see
the boy ordained.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flash of determination, of invincible Will. Yes,
it would be! It must be! He forgot the dark-cornered
room; he saw the cathedral, the procession
of priests, the young divine. Why didn&#8217;t the
boy come? He was eager to stamp his plan with
the seal of realization. A shaft of sunlight shooting
through the window struck the chair opposite
him. His sick heart bounded. Seated there he saw
his old friend and enemy, Joseph Abravanel. He
slowly made his way to the chair, passing his hand
over it; it was empty. His thought had conjured
up a momentary vision. How often had they sat
like that, opposite each other at a table set with
fruit and wine, the long evening passing like a flash
over the chess board which became symbolical of
the spiritual struggle between them. The tenacity
of that old man, who would not give up hope, even
after the conversion of his daughter!</p>

<p>&#8220;You have won this time, but there is the next
generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Julie was born, he was cheated again in
this game for souls; but he would not give in,
&#8220;God&#8217;s chosen people cannot die; they may lose the
path, but they will find it again; they will come back
in the third generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>A spasm of fear convulsed the priest. Joseph
Abravanel had the prophetic clairvoyance of his
race. No! No! The boy was a good, faithful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
child of the Church, a believer in the true Faith.</p>

<p>He glanced again at the chair opposite; again he
met those eyes long extinct&mdash;spirit eyes.</p>

<p>The servant announced, &#8220;Joseph Abravanel
Gonzola Garrison.&#8221;...</p>

<p>Joseph threw himself with a gush of irresistible
love into the old man&#8217;s arms; then, remembering,
he dropped on his knees and kissed the ring of His
Eminence. The Cardinal raised him, looking long
into that mobile face aglow with the joy of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Joseph, we have much to talk over.
No! no! not there, here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to a chair close beside him; there
were three now at the table&mdash;indomitable spirits;
one, invisible.</p>

<p>The Cardinal felt his way, asked about the
family; he had not heard from Julie for some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother is a bad correspondent, but if I
miss a mail she cables.&#8221; His laughter rang through
the high-vaulted room. &#8220;Father wants me to go
into the banking business; the Gonzolas think I
have talent for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was peeling an apple, careful not to break the
ring; the Cardinal noticed his long tapering fingers,
his white hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s eyes shot a mischievous gleam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our great ancestor on my father&#8217;s side was a
baker, on my mother&#8217;s side they added a letter to
it, and it became banker. Now if it is true that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
third generation goes back, I think I&#8217;d rather make
cakes than money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cardinal laughed; the boy&#8217;s merriment was
contagious. Then he grew grave again.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, there is something in each generation
which belongs neither to the Past nor the Present,
but to the Future; it is God&#8217;s will working in us.
The time has come to tell you of my wishes for you.
I want you to continue my work, to take up the staff
of Divine Duty, to lay upon the altar of renunciation
the great gifts bestowed upon you by an All-Seeing
God; you will give your youth, your manhood,
your old age, to save those helpless souls who
need your intercession, your spiritual support. You
will one day succeed me in Rome; it has been my
only earthly dream, ever since I held you as an infant
in my arms. My time is short; I want to see
you enter upon the path before I die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy was on his feet, his face quivering with
grief, the tears streaming from his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; you must not die! I love you! I love
you! If I could prolong your life for one hour I
would give my right hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held it up, firm, strong, beautiful. The
Cardinal&#8217;s imagination played him a trick again.
He saw another white hand held up, old, feeble,
trembling; the light shone through it.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s heart was heavy&mdash;that beloved face
before him, with the pallor of death on it. How
could he say what he must?...</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>&#8220;I have thought long and deeply of your wishes
for me. I cannot! I cannot! There is something
in me that rebels against the chastisement of the
flesh. I don&#8217;t want to think always of death, to
pray always; I want to work, I want to live. No
one can intercede for me; I can intercede for no
one. Each must work out his own salvation. The
old world is spiritually decaying; the young must be
the pioneers of a new world. We must tear down
and dig and set the stones of a new foundation, and
those who come after us will build. The Future
will see miracles; the human being will awaken to
the truth, that he himself is God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! Blasphemer!&#8221; The old man broke into
choking sobs. &#8220;Joseph! Joseph! I am responsible
for your soul&#8217;s salvation; this is all madness! You
will repent when it is too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father! it hurts me to give you pain, but it is
impossible. I cannot! I cannot!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cardinal was cold to the soul&mdash;his boy, his
heart&#8217;s idol, a heretic, an infidel; the stripling was
strange to him, standing there with a look in his
face of iron determination. He would break that
will; he must!</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know what you are doing. You are
too young. You have been influenced by that old
sophisticated fox, Pedro Gonzala. I fought a
greater man than he and won; I will fight again&mdash;I
will save you, as I saved your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! They have not influenced me. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
have given up dogma, I will not be chained again by
ritual, I will not be a mummy wrapped in the superstition
of past ages. I am a living, thinking being.
I am free! free!&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest&#8217;s eyes went past him to that shadowy
figure, looking down now, as it had so often done in
life, at a chess board on the table, fingering the
pieces, moving, removing, trying new combinations.
Neither had won; it was a drawn game;&mdash;stalemate.
With a low moan he sank back in his chair.</p>

<p>The boy gave a cry of terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, speak to me! Speak to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest heard him not. He had renounced
this world for the glory of the next. He was going
to his reward, where there would be no dogma, no
ritual, no religion.</p>

<p>A terrible fear clutched the boy. He looked
about despairingly. He was forsaking the shelter
of those old walls. He had stripped himself bare.
He must go out naked to meet the stones of the
Philistines. He threw himself down before the
beloved guide of his childhood, sobbing out his love,
his loneliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back! Come back! Don&#8217;t leave me! I
am afraid, afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p>He called in vain; those wonderful dreams&mdash;the
hope of immortality, the joy of Heaven&mdash;would
never come back; they had gone into the past, like
that still form, deaf to his entreaties, to his cries&mdash;gone
forever!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>Mr. Garrison was getting into his coat in the
hall; it was after nine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Julie, I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her answer came from above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go yet. I want to speak to you; it is
something important.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a suppressed feeling of impatience, he took
off his coat and went up the stairs. He wondered
how much Julie would ask for. She was very
extravagant. He was surprised to find her waiting
at the door of the sitting-room for him. She had
slipped out of bed and thrown on a filmy wrapper;
he was struck anew by her youthfulness. Her skin
was like satin. She was forty and could easily be
taken for ten years younger; but her beauty had
ceased to disturb him. It was an accepted fact, like
his luck in business.</p>

<p>As he bent to kiss her, she noticed his hair was
getting thin on the top. He would soon be bald.</p>

<p>He dropped down on the sofa beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You looked tired this morning; didn&#8217;t you sleep
well?&#8221; said Julie.</p>

<p>&#8220;As well as usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd&#8217;s mind was overstrained; his accumulating
interests kept him on a severe tension. His eyes
troubled him and he wore strong owl-like spectacles
framed in tortoise shell which gave him a look of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
comic solemnity. He didn&#8217;t tell Julie how very
badly he slept; his many speculations took gibbering
forms and danced around his pillow. He spent
whole nights in his den, where a man had &#8220;sweated
blood.&#8221; He was beginning to feel the significance
of that expression. At first the thought of possessing
a million made his head reel, now he laughed at
his modest pretensions. Desire grows until it ceases
to be servant and becomes master. He hunted gain
like a gambler who risks his last dollar. Envious
competitors said, &#8220;Garrison&#8217;s getting to be a skin-flint;
he&#8217;d sell his soul for money.&#8221;</p>

<p>It came back to him from a friend; he wasn&#8217;t
annoyed, but wondered in a vague way if it were
really true.</p>

<p>When the news arrived of Cardinal Cabello&#8217;s
sudden death and Joseph&#8217;s decision, Julie took it
very hard; she spent days in the convent praying
for her son&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>Floyd consulted with Dr. McClaren.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get over it. It&#8217;s only a temporary disturbance.
A bit of good news now will set her all
right again. And how are you, Mr. Garrison? My
medicine worked well, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! yes,&#8221; said Floyd, &#8220;but times are bad&mdash;a
man must be careful how he invests his money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That never troubles me; I haven&#8217;t any to
invest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been a successful doctor, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>The trouble with Dr. McClaren was that his
bills were ridiculously small.</p>

<p>&#8220;He underestimates his own ability,&#8221; said Floyd
to Julie. &#8220;A man must set the price of his life&#8217;s
work, and as he appraises himself, the world values
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a letter from Joseph,&#8221; answered Julie.</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I; he keeps me well posted on complications
abroad; I am sure, if he will only get down
to it, he&#8217;ll make a first-class financier.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Floyd&#8217;s ambition for his son.</p>

<p>She took a letter from the table beside her. It
was long, covering many sheets of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gonzalas have been very good to him; he
is in much better spirits. It was terrible, that
struggle with His Eminence. I would have
given in.&#8221;</p>

<p>She always thought now of Cabello as &#8220;His
Eminence,&#8221; in glittering robes, sparkling with
jewels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Floyd. &#8220;You always gave in. That
was the trouble.&#8221; He turned to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop a moment; you must hear this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed away the call of business; he would
rather have read it himself, when he found time, at
luncheon perhaps. He hated to be read to. He
couldn&#8217;t concentrate; his mind wandered off in
figures. She read in a low voice very rapidly, stopping
now and again; he knew she was skipping
something; he wasn&#8217;t offended. He had always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
felt like a third party, and thought of Joseph as
&#8220;Julie&#8217;s boy.&#8221; It was an interesting letter written
in picturesque metaphors, just the way Julie&#8217;s
mother used to speak, thought Floyd. The boy
told of his many visits to Frankfort, and of closer
acquaintance with Pedro Gonzala, and his granddaughter.
They had given a costume ball to celebrate
her sixteenth birthday.</p>

<p>&#8220;A costume ball&mdash;that&#8217;s rather sporty,&#8221; remarked
Floyd. He had in mind those French
masquerades given in his youth, where Martin
danced the Can-Can with indecent French women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; answered Julie, &#8220;listen; Joseph explains
it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;This was a ball, where the family personated their ancestors,
the portraits in the gallery. Ruth took me around, told me their
history for generations back. Wonderful, so full of struggle,
tragedy, romance. I couldn&#8217;t hear enough of it!&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t affect me like that&mdash;those portraits you
sent away gave me a cold chill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were not your ancestors,&#8221; said Julie with
a touch of sarcasm. Then she went on reading.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;They called one of the portraits &#8216;the unhappy Pedro Gonzala,&#8217;
because he was an illegitimate son. That was Grandfather! I
couldn&#8217;t tear myself away from him; he had such brave defiant
eyes. Dearest Mother, I think it is a great injustice to brand a
human being like that. There is nothing illegitimate in Nature.
I&#8217;d rather be the child of love, than of calculation born in wedlock.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Floyd frowned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t approve of those views. I&#8217;m afraid the
boy is catching European radicalism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie didn&#8217;t answer; she was absorbed in the letter.
Floyd looked at his watch and jumped up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, wait, it is not finished.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Mother, I&#8217;ve written you often about Ruth, but I&#8217;m sure you
don&#8217;t know what she is like. When I am with her, I&#8217;m afraid to
look at her, and when I&#8217;m away, I can&#8217;t imagine how she looks.
She&#8217;s something indescribable. Mother, I have fought with all
my might against her, because I knew it was hopeless, but when
she said she loved me, I went straight to her grandfather. I told
him about the struggle with my conscience and our dear friend&#8217;s
sudden death&mdash;he was very much moved, and put his hand over
my head and blessed me; then I took courage and asked him for
Ruth. He was silent a long time before he answered. I could see
he was thinking deeply. Then he said: &#8216;The uncompromising adherence
of our people to the Law in the days of the Ghetto preserved
the virility of the Race; but today our blood is in the veins
of the world. That obstinate orthodoxy with which we are reproached
has saved us from being swept away in a great tidal
wave of assimilation. Come to us! We will leave you free in all
worldly matters, but you must live according to our ritual, you must
worship in our synagogue, you must bring up your children in our
tradition. You will realize as you get older the righteousness of
my demands.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Floyd was annoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They <i>will</i> keep harping on those future generations.
How can we lay down the law for our
grandchildren; they&#8217;ll know a lot more than we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julie evidently didn&#8217;t agree, she kept on reading.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I walked about for days&mdash;trying to find some way&mdash;I wanted
Ruth! Mother&mdash;you don&#8217;t know how much! I couldn&#8217;t keep away
from her&mdash;she was waiting for me in the garden; she knew I
would come. Mother, there was something so pure about her;
such sweetness, I have never seen in any human thing. She was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
pale, but she spoke quietly. &#8216;Joseph, I know what Grandfather has
asked you to do for my sake; you mustn&#8217;t do it. It wouldn&#8217;t be
right for you. We try to bring the Past into the Present, to preserve
our religion. We think we live, but it is only a waking
dream, and we are happy they let us dream; but dreams are not
for you. Joseph, you must go out on the high road of Progress&mdash;and
I&mdash;I must stay here with my grandfather.&#8217; Then I fell into
the depths of despair and cried, how I cried. &#8216;I won&#8217;t let you; it
is a living death; you are young! young!&#8217; Mother, I&#8217;ll never forget
her face when she answered. &#8216;I look young, but my soul
is old.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>A sob choked Julie&#8217;s voice; herself at sixteen,
with that &#8220;old soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd took the letter and read it rapidly to the
finish.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;She has shown me the way; it is all clear to me now, and I am
not unhappy. We are only separated for a little while; and
Mother, I want you to write a letter to her grandfather&mdash;and
plead for us. It might do some good. You are always asking me
what I want. I want Ruth; give me Ruth!&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It was pathetic how the boy clung to his childish
illusions. His mother could give him everything.
Julie was crying silently.</p>

<p>The letter dropped from Floyd&#8217;s hand; waves of
memory swept over him. The struggle between
Joseph Abravanel and Father Cabello against him&mdash;the
bitterness, the tragedy. He was on his feet;
there was a youthful ring in his voice which had
long been absent. He flung his spectacles, that
badge of age, on the table. His eyes were young
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>&#8220;We must bring it about; the boy must not be
disappointed. He must have his love dream; he
must not lose the best part of his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cry of joy Julie came to him and put her
arms around his neck; they stood together, the light
of that young romance across the sea reflected in
their faces. Floyd bent down and whispered: &#8220;I
was an ardent lover, wasn&#8217;t I, Julie? You were so
sweet, so sweet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he remembered a business deal, and put on
his spectacles. At the door he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall write at once to Pedro Gonzala and
make him a business proposition, which it would be
madness to refuse; it will be a brilliant future for
Joseph. This will cure him. He will see now that
money can buy him everything! Don&#8217;t cry, Julie;
it&#8217;s all for the best, and don&#8217;t miss the mail. It&#8217;s a
five-cent stamp to Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel lunched that day at the club, with
Floyd, who was full of his plan to &#8220;dazzle&#8221; the
Gonzolas. The Colonel was very sympathetic, then
he said with a touch of sadness,</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting old. People have no use for a
bachelor, when he ceases to be eligible. If I had a
boy like yours, a wife like yours, I&#8217;d be a happy
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd thought a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been lucky; I come out well from very
serious complications.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel thought he meant business deals.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>&#8220;You often risked too much; you were once on
the brink of disaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than once,&#8221; answered Floyd, &#8220;but now
things seem to be going my way. I would like to do
some philanthropic construction work; a man must
have something to keep him from drying up.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a responsive flash from the Colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I was the only one who thought like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Floyd looked around at the crowded room; there
was laughter, jingling of glasses, the perfume of
good tobacco.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they all do!&#8221;</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>Joseph had spent the winter in Geneva, studying
the classic and modern languages. In the spring he
joined a band of students, on a walking tour
through the mountains. At Tarasp he bade them
good-bye&mdash;he was going to see the Val Sinestra,
where his mother, years before, had been caught in
a storm and where his father&#8217;s best friend, his Uncle
Martin, had been lost in the mountains.</p>

<p>He passed the hotel, climbed down into the
ravine, and stood before the little chapel, where by
a strange coincidence they had met Father Cabello.
He pushed open the door. How old it was, how
very old!&mdash;the fading wall pictures, the broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
windows, the time-stained Virgin and Child looming
up out of the shadows. There was a sudden
impulse to go to her, to speak to her, as he used to,
when she was living to him. He gazed and gazed;
she was drawing him down the aisle&mdash;</p>

<p>He went out, shutting the door softly behind him.
Ghosts followed him as he climbed up the open
road; then they melted away in the warm sunlight.</p>

<p>He was soon going home. His father&#8217;s
&#8220;dazzling&#8221; business proposition had been enthusiastically
received by the younger Gonzolas&mdash;but
the &#8220;old gentleman&#8221; remained obdurate. The boy
must accept his conditions. Floyd had written to
Joseph, advising him to &#8220;give in while the old man
lived.&#8221; But Joseph refused to make any concession;
Ruth wouldn&#8217;t let him.</p>

<p>He strolled along, his knapsack on his back, his
hat and cape in his belt, a handsome young student;
one meets them often in the mountains&mdash;fine happy
lads, their only wealth, the Future. He knelt down
by a stream, caught the falling water in his hands,
and drank it; then he poetized.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Spring dances in the mountains.</div>
<div class="verse">Winter&#8217;s young daughter, peeps at her</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet face in the Lake mirror.</div>

<div class="verse">He flies to the heights, in his</div>

<div class="verse">Wedding bells, birds caroling&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Cattle calls&mdash;Alpine horns,</div>
<div class="verse">Love time!</div>
</div></div>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed&mdash;Ruth
would like it. He would bring her and show her
where he wrote it&mdash;on their wedding day!</p>

<p>He read it again; it was a whimsical thing. He
was sorry for the poets of the past who were
chained in rhyme. The world had been rhyming so
long, about everything&mdash;love, religion, the soul, the
origin of man. People rhymed themselves into a
state of poetic fiction; then suddenly they found out
it was all rhyme and no reason.</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>The path ran along the side of the mountain. In
the valley below he saw people running, heard the
sound of music in the distance. He stopped a barefoot
boy, who told him it was f&ecirc;te day in the
Canton, to welcome their great Switzer home from
Geneva, the artist Staehli.</p>

<p>&#8220;Staehli? Yes, I know. I admired his paintings
at the exhibition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he saw a procession of peasants in gala
array, cows adorned with flowers, maidens singing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
dancing. A tall man walked amongst them with
swinging step, a peasant like the others. He puts
his hand to his mouth and gives out a long piercing
yodel. Above at a ch&acirc;let a woman answers.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Angela, his wife; she is the doctor of
the Dorf; she heals with her hands and brews herb
tea which has a magic power!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;d like to meet the artist. Do you think
he&#8217;ll receive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! All are welcome; they have the best
milk and cheese in the village. I&#8217;ll take you down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Near the ch&acirc;let, they were stopped by an
enormous hay wagon drawn by oxen. The young
peasant leading them moved aside, smiling at
Joseph.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Martin Staehli, born and raised here,&#8221;
said the boy.</p>

<p>The artist was standing outside the ch&acirc;let watching
the procession wind its way around the path and
out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I rest here awhile? I&#8217;ve walked from
Tarasp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have great pleasure.&#8221; He spoke English
hesitatingly with a Swiss accent.</p>

<p>They entered a very large room, the light
streaming in from all sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my studio. My home is a little distance
away in our family ch&acirc;let. It is old; I will show it
to you if you are interested in antiques.&#8221; He went
to the door and called.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>&#8220;Angela! Angela!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked keenly at the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not a European?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am an American.&#8221; He raised his head
with a gesture of pride which became him well.
&#8220;My name is Joseph Abravanel Gonzola Garrison.&#8221;</p>

<p>The artist put his hand over his eyes: Julie&#8217;s boy!
The child he had held in his arms! He heard again
that sweet young voice, felt the soft lips pressed
against his. &#8220;I love you, Uncle Martin.&#8221; Julie&#8217;s
boy!</p>

<p>Angela came in with milk, bread, and cheese.
Joseph thought she was the noblest-looking woman
he had ever seen.</p>

<p>The artist sat tracing lines on paper. He must
hold that vision of the past; it would soon vanish.
Angela apologized for his silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband is sketching you, he loves beautiful
heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joseph sat willingly for the artist.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only for myself&mdash;and for you, if you will
accept it.&#8221; Then pointing to a black band around
the boy&#8217;s arm, he said with a touch of fear, &#8220;Are
you in mourning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for our dearest friend, Cardinal Cabello.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cabello, a Cardinal? I am quite out of the
world. I met him many years ago in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He helped my mother bring me up. I was like
his own son. I had to grieve him terribly before
his death; but I couldn&#8217;t help it. I must go soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
again to Rome; there is a large sum of money coming
to the Church from my grandmother. It was
left to me conditionally&mdash;I have forfeited it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look so sad,&#8221; said the artist. &#8220;I want the
brightness of you. Tell me, have you sisters and
brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am an only child, and very much spoilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your parents, are they&mdash;living?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, and still young. My mother is the most
beautiful woman in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>The artist caught the smile, then set him talking
again, looking keenly into his face with its quick
changes, its light and shade. He laughed often; he
would throw back his head with a gush of merriment.
That laugh thrilled the artist; it was like a
far-away echo; it played on the chord of remembrance,
bringing out a melody long unheard.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not of pure American stock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, my mother and grandmother were born
there. Mother is of Spanish-Hebrew blood.
Father is of Dutch extraction; he is proud of being
&#8216;pure American&#8217;&mdash;he forgets the Indian. All others
are of emigrant origin; only some came over on
earlier ships. A European called us a melting pot.
I hate that expression; people don&#8217;t melt. We are
not a smelting furnace. To me the United States
is like a big Colonial mansion, with many windows
made up of little panes of glass, which I call Race.
Each one colors his glass with his own racial
impulse.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>&#8220;What color do you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my window looks toward the East where
the sun rises; it is gorgeous, with many colors,&#8221;
laughed the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I catch your meaning. It would make
a good symbolical picture. A great prairie, and
standing in it a White House built on Colonial
lines. It is flooded with a glare of strong light,
which in the individual separates into its prismatic
colors&mdash;the different races.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I mean; only an artist could
think it out like that. Will you paint it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps some day, but why not you? You have
the instinct in you; I feel it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s face lit up. &#8220;How strange you should
know that. I love art; I&#8217;ve studied it in Paris.
I&#8217;ve been dabbling a bit in oil. They say I have
talent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man bent forward. &#8220;I have a class of young
artists in Geneva; they are all unusually gifted.
Join us!&#8221; How eager he was; he hung on to the
boy&#8217;s answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like it, but an artist&#8217;s career is too
passive for me. I have no patience. I want action,
results; I want to work for the great World Reformation
which is coming. I want to help bring down
to this miserable, unhappy earth, a little of the
Heaven we have been dreaming of so long. We
must wake up! We must commence now and fight
the monster of materialism which is destroying us.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
He was on his feet, his head erect, his eyes blazing.
A young David sharpening his sword for the great
encounter with the Giant of superstition, lies, false
Gods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go now. May I come again? I&#8217;m going
to write all about you to my mother. Were you
here that time they were caught in the storm?&#8221;</p>

<p>Angela put her hand on her husband&#8217;s shoulder.
He started, looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in America, I was very unfortunate
there. I often lost my way&mdash;in jungles. Race
instinct made me restless. The peasant blood was
strong in me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Race instinct?&#8221; repeated the boy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve felt
that&mdash;but I didn&#8217;t know what it was, stirring in me.
I can&#8217;t express it. It was like a melody&mdash;from far,
far away, coming back in snatches&mdash;like&mdash;like the
strains of&mdash;a National Hymn. It excites me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angela&#8217;s eyes shone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are living a great romance, the romance of
race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The romance of race, yes, that&#8217;s what it is.&#8221;
Then he came nearer to them, and told his love
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth is to me not only my love, she is the ideal
in my life. I am going to take her out of that
beautiful dark house with its old portraits. I am
going to make her soul young again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The artist went with him down the path to the
bend of the road.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>&#8220;Where shall I send the sketch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the College in Geneva. Would you mind if
I gave it to my mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I will try to make it beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joseph lingered, looking again into the artist&#8217;s
face with a touch of sadness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel as if I had known you a very long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew the boy to him and kissed him and stood
watching the young figure until it disappeared.</p>

<p>Angela touched his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Angela! that boy! that boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he the son of the unhappy man who spent the
night here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The young peasant sent out a call from the barn,
where he was flinging the hay lightly with a heavy
pitchfork into the loft.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with our boy? He
does not care for books; he has no talent for painting?
You are not ambitious for him&mdash;&#8221; There
was a note of reproach in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, very ambitious. I want him to be what
nature has made him, a peasant; nothing could be
nobler.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night the artist remained in his studio to
finish the sketch; he worked for hours with intense
concentration, until the pencil dropped from his
numb fingers. Then he threw himself down on the
couch, but couldn&#8217;t rest. Ashes strewn over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
fire had smothered but not extinguished it; the
flames broke through. That boy! The Past living
again, with all its wonder of passion, its uncontrollable
love. He went to the window, leaned out;
a white mist hovered over the dark valley. His
eyes pierced it deeper. He was again a desperate
man, holding a woman in his arms&mdash;Mad
Martin!...</p>

<p>When the sketch was finished he painted it on
ivory, framed it in silver, put it in a velvet case, and
sent it to Joseph as a souvenir of their meeting. It
was a speaking likeness; it went over the sea, a
message to his first love.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>The Garrisons were &#8220;at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reception tonight was in honor of a distinguished
Englishman. Julie stood before the
mirror, putting the last touches to her toilette; she
wore a creamy lace d&eacute;collet&eacute; gown, with splashes
of red velvet. The Gonzola diamonds glittered in
her corsage.</p>

<p>Her maid handed her a letter and package. It
was from Joseph; now the evening would be
perfect.</p>

<p>The boy was full of hope, enthusiasm; he had
just returned from Switzerland, where he saw the
Val Sinestra and the old chapel she had told him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
about when he was a child, at night, before he went
to sleep.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I visited an artist who lives near there. He&#8217;s been in America;
he didn&#8217;t say much about himself, but he drew me out to get
atmosphere for a portrait he made of me, which I am sending to
you, with my best love. I am writing him a long letter; I hope
he will answer. He&#8217;s married to a wonderful woman; they say
she has magnetic power, and it is true; she drew out all my
secrets. I had to tell her about Ruth. She loves her husband with
her whole soul&mdash;her eyes never leave him. They have a son, a
big strong peasant lad. Mother, the artist is the most interesting
man I have ever met; his hair is turning gray. He must have
had a terrible struggle when he was young. I think he starved;
he has deep lines in his face. I had to tear myself away. I love
him, Mother, I love him! and I&#8217;m sure he loves me. When I
left, he put his arms around me and kissed me; I felt his heart
beating in big throbs.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Martin&#8217;s heart-beats!&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened the package; Joseph laughed back at
her. She gazed and gazed, until the young face
vanished, and she saw Martin, with her boy in his
arms.</p>

<p>She sank down in her chair in a rush of hysterical
joy.</p>

<p>Martin alive! Happy; no! no! not happy&mdash;content,
peaceful, at work. How wonderful!
Those two had met; they loved each other. God
had given her absolution. How thankful she was!
how thankful!</p>

<p>She sprang up, peered into the mirror, and saw&mdash;a
white despairing face with spotted gray unkempt
hair; it faded slowly; youth had touched it. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
beautiful smiling woman was reflected there, with
head erect, triumphant, free from that haunting
fear of years.</p>

<p>She put out the lights and went to the door with
resilient steps&mdash;then stopped, suddenly grew pale,
as she looked back. The room was shadowy; one
lamp shone down on the little table beside her bed,
bringing out in sharp relief, the torn old Hebrew
prayer book, beside it an ivory crucifix turning yellow,
and&mdash;a beautiful rose, eternally young&mdash;symbols
of her soul&#8217;s secrets, its melody, its
madness.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
